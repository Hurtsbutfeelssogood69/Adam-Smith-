										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>&#8220;The fact that prevention strategies related to changing sexist and misogynistic language and behavior dominated Twitter discourse is promising&#8230;&#8221;</em></p>
<p>In the days after #MeToo started trending in October 2017, Twitter users responded with <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/bradesposito/how-i-will-change?utm_term=.paav46kg2#.open9X2N1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#HowIWillChange</a> asking men to prevent sexual violence and support survivors. A <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0886260518808854?rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dpubmed&amp;url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&amp;journalCode=jiva" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="broken_link">new study in the Journal of Interpersonal Violence</a> highlights the impacts of this trending hashtag.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-21532 alignleft" src="http://www.preventconnect.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/howiwillchange-300x164.png?x47887" alt="" width="293" height="160" srcset="http://www.preventconnect.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/howiwillchange-300x164.png 300w, http://www.preventconnect.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/howiwillchange.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 293px) 100vw, 293px" /><a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-11/buso-btu110518.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alyssa Harlow&#8217;s team with the Boston University School of Public Health</a> studied nearly 1,500 #HowIWillChange tweets. Over half of the tweets had primary prevention messages and another third were calling on each other to intervene when they see violence or hear misogynistic jokes or statements, to support survivors, and to hold those who cause harm accountable.</p>
<p>Not only is this Twitter conversation capable of creating lasting cultural shifts and social norms change, but the prevention strategies shared with #HowIWillChange also provide an excellent jumping off point for advancing prevention education. For example, in addition to role modeling positive behaviors for children, <a href="https://www.nsvrc.org/sites/default/files/2014-01/saam_2014_understanding-sexual-violence-tips-for-parents-and-caregivers.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">parents can also talk with children of all ages about personal boundaries and healthy development</a>. Or, those who said they would examine their male privilege as their #HowIWillChange action can also read up on how<a href="http://www.preventconnect.org/2017/12/power-privilege-and-prevention/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> various forms of oppression (like racism, heterosexism, cissexism, etc.) contribute to high rates of violence</a>, and they can be vocal activists for intersectionality and sexual violence prevention in their peer circles.</p>
<img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-21534 alignright" src="http://www.preventconnect.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-08-at-2.29.25-PM-300x185.png?x47887" alt="" width="347" height="214" srcset="http://www.preventconnect.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-08-at-2.29.25-PM-300x185.png 300w, http://www.preventconnect.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-08-at-2.29.25-PM.png 508w" sizes="(max-width: 347px) 100vw, 347px" />
<p>There were some tweets in opposition to #HowIWillChange and sexual violence prevention. These critiques illuminate which myths and misperceptions we can reframe and correct. Harnessing the momentum of Twitter trends can take our prevention efforts to new platforms and beyond our immediate communities. It is impossible to be comprehensive in our prevention efforts in 280 characters, so we must be strategic with Twitter and other social media. Berkeley Media Studies Group recently released <a href="http://www.preventconnect.org/2018/10/new-resources-on-prevention-communication-and-media-messaging/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">two prevention communication guides</a>&#8211;one with <a href="http://www.raliance.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RALIANCE</a> and one with the <a href="https://www.nsvrc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">National Sexual Violence Resource Center</a>&#8211;to help prevention practitioners craft effective, strategic prevention messages and communicate those messages with media outlets.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An important conversation has occurred in the pages of the latest online edition of <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/home/vaw" class="broken_link"><em>Violence Against Women</em></a> exploring aspects in the work to prevent sexual violence and specifically efforts to engage bystanders.</p>
<p>In the article titled,  &#8220;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/1077801217753322" class="broken_link">Bystander Training as Leadership Training: Notes on the Origins, Philosophy, and Pedagogy of the Mentors in Violence Prevention Model</a>,&#8221; Jackson Katz provides a comprehensive history of the long-running <a href="https://www.mvpstrat.com/">Mentors in Violence Prevention</a> (MVP) program. Katz also highlights the importance of social justice-oriented approaches to preventing sexual violence that seek to change harmful social norms and critiques bystander strategies that focus solely on interrupting individual events without incorporating gender transformative conversations within their trainings.</p>
<p>Over the years, engaging bystanders has become a common approach towar<span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">d preventing sexual violence, especially on college campuses. There are numerous bystander intervention programs that at their core all seek to reduce incidence of sexual violence. Bystander intervention approaches have helped shift efforts that focus exclusively on perpetrators and survivors to efforts that elevate the role that every member of a community plays in prevention.</span></p>
<img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-21142 alignright" src="http://www.preventconnect.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Bystander-Intervention1-1-300x201.jpg?x47887" alt="" width="300" height="201" srcset="http://www.preventconnect.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Bystander-Intervention1-1-300x201.jpg 300w, http://www.preventconnect.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Bystander-Intervention1-1.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />
<p>Three response articles on Katz&#8217;s commentary and a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/1077801217753321" class="broken_link">final response from Katz</a> also appear in the journal.<a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/1077801217753320" class="broken_link"> Ann L. Coker</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/1077801217753323" class="broken_link">Elizabeth Miller</a>, and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/1077801217753324" class="broken_link">Elizabeth Wilmerding, Mari Knuth-Bouracee and Jeffrey L. Edleson</a> authored these articles. The responses affirm the importance and place of social justice oriented efforts to prevent violence, while also raising important additional issues and questions. For example, Miller discusses how gender transformative programs challenge rigid norms of traditional masculinity making them a useful strategy to reduce sexual violence as well as homophobic bullying and sexual harassment. Miller says, &#8220;&#8230;the research on adolescent relationship abuse and sexual violence prevention point to key modifiable areas and approaches related to transforming gender norms, addressing homophobia, integrating with comprehensive sexuality education, and acknowledging the unique needs of youth already violence exposed.&#8221;  Another point, raised by Coker, is that research can assist prevention practitioners in determining what prevention efforts are successful. Coker points out the importance of using data to inform the prevention strategies and approaches that are being implemented and discusses the acceptance level of communities as a context for finding what works. Wilmderding, Knuth-Bouracee and Edleson advocate for a comprehensive approach to prevention with multiple messages that reinforce each other to change culture and prevent violence.</p>
<p>It is clear that sexual violence and related forms of violence are widespread, complex issues that require multiple prevention strategies and approaches. At the heart of prevention work is the need to change the factors that allow sexual violence to take place in the first place. Social justice seeks to address those factors and science provides us with the data and tools to get there. As we continue to learn more about what works to prevent violence, conversations such as this one between prevention practitioners, researchers, and advocates will remain necessary. Katz identifies the current social moment as a pivotal time to advance sexual violence prevention and this conversation is certainly part of that.</p>

It can be a huge challenge to keep up.</p>
<p>Pew Research Center released a report on their 2014-2015 nationally representative survey of teenagers aged 13-17 about their internet and social media use. The report has a lot of really useful information, including how app and network use varies by race, income, age, and more. Surprisingly (to me, anyway), Facebook is still at the top of the list of social networks for teenagers across the board.</p>
<p>The report, which you can find <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/04/09/teens-social-media-technology-2015/" target="_blank">here</a>, also has useful information on how often teenagers access the internet, the different devices they use, and more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As prevention folks, we’re pretty familiar with the statistics about the prevalence of sexual violence. But most of the figures we use, at least here in the US come from the US alone. How do other countries compare? Is there a lot of difference from country to country?</p>
<p>It’s not always an easy question to answer. Often, different countries use different surveys that make it hard to compare figures – that is, if a country collects data about sexual violence at all.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report released a short article about sexual violence against children in seven low-income countries (Cambodia, Haiti, Kenya, Malawi, Swaziland, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe).</p>
<img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-19546 aligncenter" src="http://www.preventconnect.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/highlighted-map-300x139.png?x47887" alt="highlighted map" width="524" height="242" srcset="http://www.preventconnect.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/highlighted-map-300x139.png 300w, http://www.preventconnect.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/highlighted-map-1024x473.png 1024w, http://www.preventconnect.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/highlighted-map.png 1236w" sizes="(max-width: 524px) 100vw, 524px" />
<p>It turns out that sexual violence is a major problem in most of these other countries, just as it is in the US. In five of the seven countries, at least 25% of women aged 18-24 had experienced some form of sexual violence before age 18. That figure varied more, from 6% of men in Cambodia to 21% of men in Haiti.</p>
<p>The study also has information about how many people who had experienced sexual violence as children received services, and more details about the different figures in different countries.</p>
<p>But the overall message is clear: sexual violence is a global problem.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It can be really complicated to judge the quality of research studies. You can get deep into concerns about how a survey question was worded, how the timing of the evaluation or repetition of testing affected the responses people gave, how appropriate the data management and statistical analysis methods used were, and other nuanced, difficult questions. These questions are important, and are often addressed in reviews of multiple studies, but they’re not necessarily the kinds of questions I ask the first time I read a study.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="  wp-image-19217 alignright" src="http://www.preventconnect.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/magnifying-glass-300x200.jpg?x47887" alt="magnifying glass" width="318" height="212" srcset="http://www.preventconnect.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/magnifying-glass-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.preventconnect.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/magnifying-glass-1024x682.jpg 1024w, http://www.preventconnect.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/magnifying-glass.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 318px) 100vw, 318px" />And even reviews of studies are looking for certain components in studies that don’t necessarily have to do with the quality of the research. The CDC’s review of sexual violence prevention was looking for programs that were rigorously evaluated and demonstrated effectiveness in reducing violent behavior. In the whole fields of sexual and intimate partner violence prevention, only three programs and a federal policy fit these criteria, and we don’t even know exactly which aspects of those programs reduced violent behavior. And of course, these three programs are not necessarily appropriate for all communities.</p>
<p>We have a lot to learn from studies that don’t fit the criteria of the CDC’s review, or of other reviews. For instance, we can learn about risk and protective factors that are important for certain communities, strategies that are associated with reducing risk factors of perpetration, or interesting approaches or underlying principles for prevention programming. To do that, we need to be able to recognize which studies are stronger and which are weaker – which we should trust more, and which we should take with a grain (or a handful) of salt. It’s good to be able to read a study and get a general feel for whether you trust its conclusions or not. That’s what I do when I look through research studies and decide what to write about and what to say on PreventConnect.</p>
<p>I want to share what it is that I’m looking for when I read through a study. These are of the more important questions that I ask myself to decide how much I trust the study’s conclusions.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How did they choose which people in the target population would be participants?</strong> Did they get an enrolment roster at a college and email a random selection of students? Or are they a professor who only did the program with their class? The first case is definitely better if there is a large enough sample and if the program participants are meant to be representative of the broader campus population. But the second case could be useful, too—maybe that professor could have done in-depth, qualitative interviews with those students that reveal a lot of nuance about their attitudes, barriers to performing the desired behaviors, what worked and what didn’t about a program, etc.—it’s just not likely to represent the whole student body.</li>
<li><strong>How are the program participants similar and different to my community? </strong>What are their ages? Linguistic background? Gender makeup? Educational status? Race? Do they live in urban or rural areas? Income level? Community values? Could a program done with middle school students also be done with high school students? Maybe, but maybe not. Maybe a program done in San Francisco could work in Dallas, Texas. But maybe not. <strong>Importantly, </strong>this question isn’t just about how different or similar the program population is from my community, but about how these differences matter for implementing the program. Many times I’ve read an abstract that seems interesting, only to find out that the study was done with 12 adolescents in Estonia or somewhere else I’m equally unfamiliar with. And it could be that the study findings are relevant in some ways to parts of the US, but I just don’t know enough about the similarities and differences to be confident one way or the other.</li>
<li><strong>What are the research questions asking? What are they not asking? </strong>Did the study ask about actual violent behaviors or behavioral intentions, or just knowledge, attitudes, and skills? Which risk and protective factors did the study address, and which did it leave out? How does that match up with the risk and protective factors that are important in my community, or with the goals and objectives of my program? Do the research questions fit my philosophy and understanding of the problems of sexual and/or intimate partner violence?</li>
<li><strong>If I’m trying to determine whether I trust a claim that a program was effective at creating some change…</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>How many of the chosen/invited participants actually completed the program? </strong>If only 40% of the people invited participated, that can be a problem. What if the people who participated are those who are already interested in ending sexual and intimate partner violence? Their results from the program are probably going to be different than the results would have been for the other 60% of invited people. Also, if there was a comparison or control group, did a very different number of people drop out of the program group than the control group? Again, if a lot of people dropped out of the program group, I’m less likely to trust that the program was effective, even if it says it was in comparison to the control group. This is because if we had been able to measure change in the people who dropped out, we might find that they didn’t change. So considering everyone who did some part of the program, it could very well turn out that the program really didn’t make changes any differently than the control.</li>
<li><strong>What was the program compared to? </strong>Maybe there was no comparison or control group. If not, how do I know that any changes that occurred happened because of the program, and not because of some big local news story? (This might not be a problem for me. If I’m looking for innovative program activities or ways to adapt a program to a certain cultural context, I might be more interested in the content of the program than I am in being sure that the program caused certain changes.) If there <em>is</em> a comparison or control group, what activities did they do? Did they get a generic health education class, or did they just do the study without getting any sort of program? Are there different groups that got different combinations of program components (like Shifting Boundaries, where one group got a curriculum and a building intervention, one group got just a building intervention, one group got just a curriculum, and one group got nothing). Having a comparison or control group gives me more confidence that a program that says it was effective actually was.</li>
<li><strong>How was it decided which participants got which program components? </strong>This is getting nit-picky, but it is stronger if participants are randomly assigned to get the program or a control, rather than assigned based on logistics or other factors. But the reality is that most programs are given based on logistics, and it can get very expensive to have random assignment to different program groups, so I go easy on this one.</li>
<li><strong>How long after the program were post-tests administered (if there were pre- and post-tests)? </strong>The longer, the better. It’s not as important to me that a participant can answer a question correctly right after they participate in a class. I’m usually more interested in whether the knowledge, attitude, intentions, etc. stick with them over time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>If I’m trying to learn in-depth about program implementation, participants’ experience of a program, underlying principles for prevention, etc. in a qualitative (as opposed to quantitative) way…</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>What are the researcher’s probable biases? </strong>Any good researcher will try to identify their biases and avoid letting them define their interpretation. But it’s good to think about it and check. Is this researcher trying to promote a certain approach over others? If so, how might this affect the way they interpret what the participants say?</li>
<li><strong>What is the researcher not saying? </strong>Qualitative studies almost always have a huge amount of data that researchers have to sift through and pick out the most profound, important pieces. What kinds of things does it seem like they might have glossed over?</li>
<li><strong>Do you agree with the researcher’s interpretation of the data?</strong> Ten different people can listen to the same set of interviews and draw ten different conclusions. You probably will only be able to see a little bit of the raw data, if any, but does what you see support what the researcher has claimed?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.preventconnect.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/NIJ-Research-TDV.png?x47887"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-19171" src="http://www.preventconnect.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/NIJ-Research-TDV-230x300.png?x47887" alt="NIJ Research TDV" width="221" height="287" srcset="http://www.preventconnect.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/NIJ-Research-TDV-230x300.png 230w, http://www.preventconnect.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/NIJ-Research-TDV.png 605w" sizes="(max-width: 221px) 100vw, 221px" /></a>For teenagers, friends and peer groups have a stronger influence on attitudes and behavior than anyone else. Often, this is especially true when it comes to dating relationships. Teens’ peers can have huge influence over their decisions to start dating someone, to use violence or to build healthy relationships, to seek help or not if a dating partner is violent, and to stay in or end a relationship. If peers can have such a strong role in behaviors related to teen dating violence (TDV), it makes a lot of sense to target prevention efforts to certain risky peer networks or to use peer networks to reinforce the positive attitude, skill, and behavior changes that many prevention programs aim to make in individuals or in romantic relationships. It’s probably much harder for a teen to justify being violent in their relationship if all of their friends vocally disapprove of violence in romantic relationships and in general.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/248337.pdf">Teen Dating Violence: How peers can affect risk &amp; protective factors</a> is a recent report by the National Institute of Justice. It explores how peer groups influence TDV and how prevention practitioners can work with peer groups to prevent it. In addition to discussing practical considerations for planning prevention efforts that target peer contexts, the report talks about four main points that research has made about why peer contexts are so important for preventing TDV.</p>
<ul>
<li>Having a risky peer context, for example where peers are victims and/or perpetrators of bullying, physical violence, and cyber bullying, increases the risk of victimization and/or perpetration of TDV. Having peers who are delinquent in school or the community is an especially important risk factor for TDV.</li>
<li>Teens who experience dating violence often seek help from their peers before anyone else. Peers can help or discourage victims from seeking further help.</li>
<li>Programs that have focused on social contexts have had some positive effects for preventing TDV. The building component of <a href="http://www.preventconnect.org/2013/05/shifting_boundaries/">Shifting Boundaries</a> shapes peer contexts, and was shown to reduce victimization and increase students’ intentions to intervene in violence. Another program that provided group treatment to girls in the child welfare system reduced TDV victimization.</li>
<li>Identifying risky behaviors or risk factors for TDV perpetration among individual students can also identify entire peer networks that might be at especially high risk for TDV perpetration, and thus might benefit from targeted prevention efforts. For example, if there is a high rate of bullying at a school, that school may be at higher risk for TDV. Or, if one or more teens in a certain friend group are delinquent at school, they and their entire friend group may be at higher risk for TDV perpetration.</li>
</ul>
<p>It certainly seems like peer contexts are important for TDV prevention. How have your prevention efforts worked specifically to change social and peer contexts? How can prevention efforts make peer network change a primary goal, and not just a side effect of individual change?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure id="attachment_19157" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-19157" style="width: 200px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/cybergypsy/6488529663"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-19157 size-medium" src="http://www.preventconnect.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/feminist-man-200x300.jpg?x47887" alt="Source: Flickr Commons, Emma Campbell" width="200" height="300" srcset="http://www.preventconnect.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/feminist-man-200x300.jpg 200w, http://www.preventconnect.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/feminist-man.jpg 427w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-19157" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Flickr Commons, Emma Campbell</figcaption></figure>
<p>I’ve <a title="Prevention lessons from around the world" href="http://www.preventconnect.org/2014/12/prevention-lessons-from-around-the-world/">written a lot</a> about the <a title="New research series on global violence against women and girls" href="http://www.preventconnect.org/2014/11/new-research-series-on-global-violence-against-women-and-girls/">Lancet series</a> on Violence Against Women and Girls already, but I also really want to highlight the piece they did on working with men and boys. The article by Jewkes, Flood, and Lang is a great introductory or background piece to engaging men and boys, because it talks about the historical context of involving men in prevention, about why we want to engage men and boys, and about what strategies and approaches we should use to try to engage men today.</p>
<p>The article starts with a history of men’s involvement in prevention. Understanding this historical context is crucial for being able to understand men’s current efforts to prevent violence against women and girls. After describing this context, the article goes on to give a lot of detail about what efforts to engage men and boys in prevention can and should look like. As the <a title="Prevention lessons from around the world" href="http://www.preventconnect.org/2014/12/prevention-lessons-from-around-the-world/">lessons from prevention</a> told us, prevention work should focus on gendered power dynamics. This article gives us a good deal more information on how to do that. The main recommendation is to base efforts to engage men and boys in gender theory, both as an ideological foundation and as a guide for specific program objectives.</p>
<p>The ideas of gender theory that the article emphasizes are that gender is socially constructed, and that the dominant ideal of masculinity isn’t the only or the best kind of masculinity. The dominant ideal often involves men being tough and strong and having control and power over women, girls, and other men and boys. This connects to violence against women and girls because, “although not all men are violent, and some actively oppose violence, the use of violence over women is one source of power accorded to men in many settings.” People can be more or less able to live up to their view of gender ideals based on their socio-economic status, employment status, traumatic events, and other life circumstances. Finally, gender is relational, meaning that gender ideals, identity, and expression depend on other women and men’s expectations and approval.</p>
<p>Based on these ideas, the article suggests that the goals of prevention work with men and boys should be to transform gender ideals, expectations, and expression. The work should highlight variety in the kinds of masculinity that exist in a community, inconsistency in gender ideals, fluctuation of gender expression over time and in different circumstances, and similarities between men and women. It should also fight homophobia and reveal and challenge men’s privilege. These ideas challenge the dominant gender ideals and make room for individual men and boys to become more comfortable rejecting violent and controlling masculinity, and eventually collectively change gender norms in their community.</p>
<p>To me, the key is to not just talk about what masculinity is, why it’s connected to violence, and how it harms women, girls, men, and boys, but to figure out concrete ways to challenge men’s privilege, change what masculinity means, and create space for more variety in gender expression. A lot of programs do a good job of accomplishing these goals for individuals, but it’s harder to translate those changes to entire communities and societies. How does your work with men affect these higher levels? How can we make more community and societal change in gender expectations and ideals?</p>

<blockquote><p>“Violence perpetrated by and against men and boys is a major public health problem. Although individual men&#8217;s use of violence differs, engagement of all men and boys in action to prevent violence against women and girls is essential. We discuss why this engagement approach is theoretically important and how prevention interventions have developed from treating men simply as perpetrators of violence against women and girls or as allies of women in its prevention, to approaches that seek to transform the relations, social norms, and systems that sustain gender inequality and violence. We review evidence of intervention effectiveness in the reduction of violence or its risk factors, features commonly seen in more effective interventions, and how strong evidence-based interventions can be developed with more robust use of theory. Future interventions should emphasise work with both men and boys and women and girls to change social norms on gender relations, and need to appropriately accommodate the differences between men and women in the design of programmes.”</p></blockquote>

					<description><![CDATA[Efforts to reduce alcohol consumption can be controversial when it comes to sexual violence prevention. So let me start with&#160;&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure id="attachment_19161" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-19161" style="width: 256px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/froderik/5966641707"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-19161" src="http://www.preventconnect.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/alcohol-bottles-300x199.jpg?x47887" alt="Source: Flickr Commons, Fredrik Rubensson" width="256" height="170" srcset="http://www.preventconnect.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/alcohol-bottles-300x199.jpg 300w, http://www.preventconnect.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/alcohol-bottles.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-19161" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Flickr Commons, Fredrik Rubensson</figcaption></figure>
<p>Efforts to reduce alcohol consumption can be controversial when it comes to sexual violence prevention. So let me start with a few important points. Alcohol does not cause sexual violence. Alcohol is associated with some factors that can be associated with sexual violence perpetration, but alcohol consumption doesn’t lead to sexual violence in a vacuum. Alcohol may lower inhibitions, decrease empathy, and cause problems with judgment, but these things don’t lead to sexual violence in the absence of factors like sexual entitlement, sexual objectification, victim-blaming or rape-accepting attitudes, and a desire for power and control.</p>
<p>A new study came out that PreventConnect will soon be giving a web conference about. The study, by Lippy &amp; DeGue, looks at the potential effects that alcohol-related policies can have on sexual violence perpetration. The article does an excellent job of contextualizing the role of alcohol policy by acknowledging and describing the limitations that I just mentioned. But it also makes a good public health case for focusing on how alcohol policy can help in prevention. It’s true that alcohol consumption isn’t a root cause of sexual violence perpetration, but it does have an impact on perpetration in many populations, including a wide range of ages and people in both different- and same-sex relationships. According to the article, alcohol consumption by the perpetrator, victim, or both is a factor in about half of all sexual assaults, and about one-third to three-fourths of perpetrators had been drinking at the time of the assault. So from a public health standpoint, it makes a lot of sense to attempt to reduce alcohol consumption as a sort of quicker fix to prevent perpetration. It won’t eradicate gender inequality, patriarchy, or sexual objectification or increase empathy and healthy relationships, but it might prevent some sexual assaults in the meantime. That makes it a potentially important part of a comprehensive approach to sexual violence prevention.</p>
<p>So what did the study find? As a review of many studies related to alcohol and sexual violence, the article mostly showed that there needs to be more research related specifically to alcohol policy’s effects on sexual violence, but it also highlighted some strategies that show promise.</p>
<ul>
<li>Increasing alcohol prices through higher taxes or through prohibiting drink specials and promotions shows consistent effects of reducing sexual violence perpetration. More research is needed on policies restricting or prohibiting happy hours, which may encourage binge drinking.</li>
<li>Policies restricting the times when alcohol can be sold (like closing time laws) have mixed results in their effects on violence, but they have been shown to reduce alcohol consumption.</li>
<li>Higher alcohol outlet density has been linked to higher rates of sexual violence victimization, as well as higher rates of assault and intimate partner violence. Alcohol outlet density is the number of outlets (businesses) that sell alcohol either in a certain geographic area or compared to the population (e.g. 3 outlets on a city block, 2 outlets per 100 people living in a city, etc.). Alcohol outlet density can be regulated using alcohol sale licensing policy.</li>
<li>We need a lot more research on policies to reduce over-serving customers in bars or restaurants, but there’s some preliminary evidence that these types of policies can reduce assault and physical aggression.</li>
<li>There’s no good evidence on policies regarding placement or content of alcohol marketing, but there is evidence that being exposed to sexist alcohol marketing is related to sexual violence perpetration.</li>
<li>Policies banning alcohol on college campuses or in specific residence halls are associated with reduced sexual violence victimization. But this effect depends on the availability of alcohol in the community surrounding a campus, so policies that affect both colleges and their communities should be considered.</li>
</ul>
<p>Creating changes at the societal level to prevent sexual violence is notoriously difficult to do, and we have very little evidence for what kinds of societal-level efforts can actually reduce sexual violence perpetration. Alcohol-related policies may not address the causes of sexual violence perpetration, but it looks like they can still reduce sexual violence rates. It’s a part of the solution that definitely needs to be explored further.</p>

<blockquote><p>“Sexual violence continues to be a significant public health problem worldwide with serious consequences for individuals and communities. The implementation of prevention strategies that address risk and protective factors for sexual violence at the community level are important components of a comprehensive approach, but few such strategies have been identified or evaluated. The current review explores one potential opportunity for preventing sexual violence perpetration at the community level: alcohol policy. Alcohol policy has the potential to impact sexual violence perpetration through the direct effects of excessive alcohol consumption on behavior or through the impact of alcohol and alcohol outlets on social organization within communities. Policies affecting alcohol pricing, sale time, outlet density, drinking environment, marketing, and college environment are reviewed to identify existing evidence of impact on rates of sexual violence or related outcomes, including risk factors and related health behaviors. Several policy areas with initial evidence of an association with sexual violence outcomes were identified, including policies affecting alcohol pricing, alcohol outlet density, barroom management, sexist content in alcohol marketing, and policies banning alcohol on campus and in substance-free dorms. We identify other policy areas with evidence of an impact on related outcomes and risk factors that may also hold potential as a preventative approach for sexual violence perpetration. Evidence from the current review suggests that alcohol policy may represent one promising avenue for the prevention of sexual violence perpetration at the community level, but additional research is needed to directly examine effects on sexual violence outcomes.”</p></blockquote>

					<description><![CDATA[Two of my favorite things about the recent series on Violence Against Women and Girls in The Lancet are that&#160;&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two of my favorite things about the recent <a title="New research series on global violence against women and girls" href="http://www.preventconnect.org/2014/11/new-research-series-on-global-violence-against-women-and-girls/">series</a> on Violence Against Women and Girls in The Lancet are that they focus on prevention around the world&#8211;including efforts from low- and middle-income countries that often don’t get a lot of attention in the US&#8211;and that there is a really strong emphasis in the series on lessons learned from practice, not just from research studies. These two factors come together in “Prevention of violence against women and girls: lessons from practice” to shed some new light on what might work to prevent violence against women and girls. The article essentially summarizes some of the most important trends, successes, and challenges to shed new light on what might work in prevention.</p>
<figure style="width: 375px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.thelancet.com/cms/attachment/2020894921/2041097832/gr2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="" src="http://www.thelancet.com/cms/attachment/2020894921/2041097832/gr2.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="425" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Michau et al.&#8217;s socio-ecological model (2014).</figcaption></figure>
<p>To me, the take-away messages from the article are about addressing the root causes and inequalities that lead to violence against women and girls, thinking big, collaborating to increase impact, and being innovative.</p>
<p>A major point was that it’s crucial to maintain a focus on gender inequity and power dynamics in interpersonal relationships, communities, and societies. I think there’s sometimes a strong impulse to de-politicize prevention work by skirting issues about patriarchy, gender socialization, or other forms of oppression in order to reach broader audiences. But this article puts it plainly: “Simply stated, to be born a girl in a patriarchal society is a fundamental risk factor for various types of gender-based violence.”</p>
<p>Like much of the guidance produced in the US, this article encourages working across the socio-ecological model, and it provides some interesting ideas that we might not always consider. First of all, they included a diagram with suggestions for how to intervene at different levels that are different from the suggestions we often see in the US. They also discuss some particulars about how to focus on each level. Small-scale workshops can make significant change for individuals, but violence against women and girls is such a large-scale problem that we really need to do more. Awareness raising is also important for changing community norms, but they need to have explicit goals and content to change attitudes, norms, and behaviors, rather than just sharing statistics.</p>
<p>The article suggests that in order to really make change at the community and society levels, there has to be strong cross-sector collaboration. It encourages collaborations with policymakers, the justice system, the health care sector, and educational systems (at the organizational and policy level, not just in classrooms), as well as closer partnership between prevention researchers and practitioners. The root problems of oppression and gender inequity affect all of these sectors, and the solutions should involve them all, too.</p>
<p>Finally, the article talks about the importance of innovation. Even considering some strong programming from low- and middle-income countries, the existing evidence base is small. Some interventions in other countries have led to strong involvement of community leaders, changes in gender norms and expressions, and changes in interpersonal relationships. But we still don’t know how well those kinds of interventions will work here. Perhaps more important than replicating those programs in other countries is to be inspired by the way these programs did things differently, and to think critically about why we do what we do in our prevention programming. Thoughtful analysis of each community’s risk and protective factors might suggest doing something totally different than school-based educational sessions and a social marketing campaign. So what could work better? How can we innovate to find more strategies that create change?</p>

<p><strong>Full abstract:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>This Series paper describes programming to prevent violence against women and girls, and emphasises the importance of systematic, sustained programming across the social ecology (ie, the delicate equilibrium of interacting social, institutional, cultural, and political contexts of people’s lives) to transform gender-power inequalities. Effective prevention policy and programming is founded on five core principles: first, analysis and actions to prevent violence across the social ecology (individual, interpersonal, community, and societal); second, intervention designs based on an intersectional gender-power analysis; third, theory-informed models developed on the basis of evidence; fourth, sustained investment in multisector interventions; and finally, aspirational programming that promotes personal and collective thought, and enables activism on women’s and girls’ rights to violence-free lives. Prevention programming of the future will depend on all of us having a vision of, and a commitment to, gender equality to make violence-free lives for women and girls a reality.</p></blockquote>

<p>Mucha de la investigación sobre la violencia en el noviazgo se efectúa en inglés, y hasta ahora, todas las revisiones y meta-análisis de esta investigación eran en inglés también. Investigadores en Colombia recientemente publicaron <a href="http://www.redalyc.org/articulo.oa?id=80131179008">una revisión</a> de estudios en inglés y en español de programas de prevención de la violencia en el noviazgo que se realizaron entre 1990 y 2012. Entre los 13 estudios revisados, 10 fueron en inglés, y los 3 en español se llevaron a cabo en España, México y Chile. Todos los programas en esta revisión, incluyendo los programas en español, se desarrollaron en Estados Unidos o en Canadá. No obstante los programas en español son relativamente recientes, así que podría ser que el interés en la prevención de la violencia en el noviazgo esta creciendo en países hispanohablantes. Si es así, el cuerpo de investigación en español probablemente va a aumentarse también.</p>
<p>Todos los programas identificados intentan a educar y entrenar a estudiantes adolescentes para mejorar sus conocimientos, actitudes, habilidades y comportamientos relacionados con el noviazgo. Los programas consisten en clases de 5-21 sesiones que tienen lugar en las escuelas.</p>
<p>La calidad de los resultados de los estudios no es ideal, ya que los programas varían mucho en sus métodos, duraciones, medidas y tamaños de muestra, y la mayoría de los estudios no hicieron medidas de seguimiento. Sin embargo, generalmente los programas lograron mejorar los conocimientos y actitudes de los estudiantes aunque no lograron cambiar sus comportamientos. Desafortunadamente los participantes de todos los programas fueron estudiantes adolescentes, así que no se puede generalizar los resultados a otras poblaciones como los estudiantes universitarios o los adultos.</p>
<p>La revisión recomienda que los programas de prevención de la violencia en el noviazgo se enfoquen en cambiar comportamientos, no solamente conocimientos y actitudes, que consistan en métodos aparte de enseñanza en escuelas, que mejoren las metodologías de evaluación y que tengan participantes más diversos.</p>

<p><strong>Resumen:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“Objetivo. Se busca identificar, describir y analizar los componentes, metodología y resultados de los programas dirigidos a prevenir la violencia en el noviazgo, reseñados en artículos recuperados de las bases de datos Redalyc, Psicodoc, Science Direct, Proquest y Google académico, publicados entre enero de 1990 y noviembre de 2011. Método. Del total de artículos revisados, solo 13 cumplieron con el criterio de selección de describir la evaluación empírica de este tipo de programas, entre los que destaca el uso del entrenamiento en manejo de conflictos, habilidades para resolución de problemas, conocimientos sobre relaciones saludables, acoso / asalto sexual, cambio de actitudes sobre la violencia en el noviazgo y entrenamiento en habilidades de búsqueda de ayuda. Resultados. En general, estos artículos reportan una disminución en actitudes violentas e incremento del conocimiento sobre la violencia, aunque la mayoría no realizó una evaluación de cambio conductual y en los pocos en donde se hicieron mediciones de seguimiento, no se reporta el mantenimiento de los logros. Conclusión. Se hace necesario, para el avance del conocimiento sobre el tema, realizar estudios con una metodología más rigurosa, centrados en el cambio efectivo de conductas y mejorar la capacidad de generalización de estos estudios a poblaciones diferentes a adolescentes y adultos jóvenes escolarizados.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The Lancet, one of the top medical journals in the world, has released a <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/series/violence-against-women-and-girls" target="_blank">series of articles</a> on global efforts against violence against women and girls. The series includes five reviews of approaches to responding to violence against women, an audio file of a discussion of the series, and comments from experts. You can register with the Lancet for free, and then see the full articles in the series at no charge.</p>
<p>The series focuses on low- and middle-income countries&#8217; efforts in addition to studies from the US and other high-income countries. This is really exciting to me because a lot of low- and middle-income countries have a stronger focus on prevention than we do here, and I think there&#8217;s a lot we can learn from their work. I&#8217;ll be posting more about my take on some of the articles in the series soon.</p>

<p>Bullying prevention has been a major focus for schools for the past several years, and it can be a good entry point for sexual and dating violence prevention efforts to get into schools. Over the years, there has been <a title="Links between Bullying &amp; Sexual Violence: Possibilities for Prevention" href="http://www.preventconnect.org/2012/02/links-between-bullying-sexual-violence-possibilities-for-prevention/" target="_blank">more</a> and <a title="New research: Does bullying lead to dating aggression?" href="http://www.preventconnect.org/2012/09/new-research-does-bullying-lead-to-dating-aggression/" target="_blank">more</a> support for the “bullying – sexual violence pathway,” a theory that children who bully other children are more likely to perpetrate sexual violence, like sexual harassment, unwanted touching/groping, and maybe even more severe sexual violence, as well as teen dating violence.</p>
<p>New research by Dr. Dorothy Espelage et al. adds another dimension to this pathway that can be important for prevention. They followed almost 1,000 fifth-seventh graders for two years and measured their bullying perpetration and homophobic teasing perpetration as they related to later sexual harassment perpetration. Preventing sexual harassment is a really important goal, since according to <a title="Sexual Harassment Victimization and Perpetration Among High School Students" href="http://vaw.sagepub.com/content/20/10/1203.abstract" target="_blank" class="broken_link">another recent study</a>, about <strong>1 in 8 boys</strong> and <strong>1 in 20 girls</strong> perpetrate sexual harassment in high school. The study found that girls who bullied others at the beginning of the study were over <strong>3</strong> times more likely to sexually harass others two years later, but homophobic teasing didn’t affect this relationship. Boys who bullied others were over <strong>4.5</strong> times more likely to perpetrate sexual harassment than boys who didn’t bully, and boys who engaged in homophobic teasing were <strong>1.66</strong> times more likely to perpetrate sexual harassment than boys who didn’t. Interestingly, if boys engaged in a lot of bullying and a lot of homophobic teasing, they were even more likely to engage in sexual harassment two years later than boys who did both bully and engage in homophobic teasing, but did so rarely.</p>
<p>Clearly, preventing bullying can have a big impact on preventing sexual harassment for both boys and girls. But it looks like it can be important to also focus especially on preventing homophobic teasing by boys. Not only would this focus make a stronger connection between bullying and sexual violence, but it also supports our goals of preventing violence against all people, regardless of gender or sexual orientation, and of challenging oppressive gender roles. If boys can be free from homophobic bullying or gender policing, maybe they’ll be less likely to be hostile toward people and traits they deem feminine and more likely to be openly caring, sensitive, and empathetic.</p>

<p><strong>Full abstract: </strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“Bullying perpetration and sexual harassment perpetration among adolescents are major public health issues. However, few studies have addressed the empirical link between being a perpetrator of bullying and subsequent sexual harassment perpetration among early adolescents in the literature. Homophobic teasing has been shown to be common among middle school youth and was tested as a moderator of the link between bullying and sexual harassment perpetration in this 2-year longitudinal study. More specifically, the present study tests the Bully–Sexual Violence Pathway theory, which posits that adolescent bullies who also participate in homophobic name-calling toward peers are more likely to perpetrate sexual harassment over time. Findings from logistical regression analyses (n = 979, 5th-7th graders) reveal an association between bullying in early middle school and sexual harassment in later middle school, and results support the Sexual Harassment Victimization and Perpetration Among High School Students Bully–Sexual Violence Pathway model, with homophobic teasing as a moderator, for boys only. Results suggest that to prevent bully perpetration and its later association with sexual harassment perpetration, prevention programs should address the use of homophobic epithets.”</p></blockquote>

					<description><![CDATA[We talk a lot about how using “one-size-fits-all” programs or “programs in a box” is probably not the best way&#160;&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We talk a lot about how using “one-size-fits-all” programs or “programs in a box” is probably not the best way to prevent sexual and intimate partner violence in all of our diverse communities. An evidence-based program that was designed for mostly-white middle schoolers in a suburban area, for example, probably won’t be that effective for ethnically diverse college students in an urban area. But there’s also a strong trend toward doing prevention work that’s <a title="Understanding Evidence: New online tool for making decisions about prevention" href="http://www.preventconnect.org/2013/03/understanding-evidence-new-online-tool-for-making-decisions-about-prevention/">based in evidence</a> – <a title="Understanding Evidence" href="http://www.preventconnect.org/2011/09/understanding-evidence/">experiential, contextual, and research-based</a>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-19091 size-medium" src="http://www.preventconnect.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/adaptation-300x198.png?x47887" alt="adaptation" width="300" height="198" srcset="http://www.preventconnect.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/adaptation-300x198.png 300w, http://www.preventconnect.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/adaptation.png 876w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />What I think is the most difficult part of planning evidence-based programming is bridging experiential and contextual evidence with research evidence. Even if we have a really <a title="Culturally grounded prevention to create change" href="http://www.preventconnect.org/2014/07/culturally-grounded-prevention-to-create-change/">deep understanding of our communities</a>, it’s not necessarily easy to figure out how to use that understanding to make research-based programs fit.</p>
<p>A new <a href="http://jiv.sagepub.com/content/early/2014/10/01/0886260514552278.abstract" class="broken_link">research article</a> by Vangie Foshee and others talks about <strong>how they went about adapting</strong> the <em>Families for Safe Dates</em> (FSD) program, which aims to give parents and their adolescent children a structured guide for talking about preventing teen dating violence. The adaptation of the program, called <em>Mothers and Teens for Safe Dates</em> (MTSD), was tailored to mothers who had left abusive relationships and their adolescents.</p>
<p>First, the researchers used logic and theory. There were a lot of elements in FSD that they didn’t think would be necessary for MTSD, such as conversations about the severity of the problem of dating violence, since both the mothers and teens would have experienced the problem first-hand. They also added more activities and emphasis to some areas they thought would be really important for this population.</p>
<p>Then, they did pilot testing with some families in the target population. First, they tried to go to local courts to recruit mothers who were getting protective orders, but they weren’t able to recruit many families. They used this contextual evidence to change their approach, and started recruiting families in different ways. Similarly, they started out doing focus groups with participants to get feedback on MTSD, but most of the families didn’t show up. So they cut out the need for participants to travel to a central location by doing phone interviews instead.</p>
<p>In these interviews, they asked participants all about their experiences with MTSD. They asked both mothers and teens what they thought about the program’s structure and content – what was interesting and what wasn’t, what was difficult to talk about, whether it was convenient, what they wished there were more of, and on and on. And they learned that though some of their logical and theory-based ideas for what to change were right, some of the elements that they took out were really still important for these mothers and teens. Participants also told the researchers that some of the things they emphasized should have been emphasized even more, which both illustrated the researchers’ understanding of the population and highlighted clear ways to make the program even more relevant. The researchers used all of this information to change MTSD before doing a full-scale study on the program.</p>
<p>What I love about this article is that the researchers didn’t just tell us how effective the new MTSD program is. They tell us how they got it to be right for the target population. We can use lessons from their process in our communities. Based on our understanding of our communities, we can make some informed guesses about what parts of evidence-based programs and risk and protective factors are and aren’t important for the community, and then, of course, actually check with the community. Even better, we can ask some members of the community what parts of a program they think are relevant to them, and then verify the changes we make with more members of the community. And when we find that something isn’t working for our community, like the court-based recruitment and focus groups in this study, we can change it.</p>
<p>It’s all about taking what works in research-based programs and making it work for us.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Adolescents exposed to domestic violence are at increased risk of dating abuse, yet no evaluated dating abuse prevention programs have been designed specifically for this high-risk population. This article describes the process of adapting <em>Families for Safe Dates</em> (FSD), an evidenced-based universal dating abuse prevention program, to this high-risk population, including conducting 12 focus groups and 107 interviews with the target audience. FSD includes six booklets of dating abuse prevention information, and activities for parents and adolescents to do together at home. We adapted FSD for mothers who were victims of domestic violence, but who no longer lived with the abuser, to do with their adolescents who had been exposed to the violence. Through the adaptation process, we learned that families liked the program structure and valued being offered the program and that some of our initial assumptions about this population were incorrect. We identified practices and beliefs of mother victims and attributes of these adolescents that might increase their risk of dating abuse that we had not previously considered. In addition, we learned that some of the content of the original program generated negative family interactions for some. The findings demonstrate the utility of using a careful process to adapt evidence-based interventions (EBIs) to cultural sub-groups, particularly the importance of obtaining feedback on the program from the target audience. Others can follow this process to adapt EBIs to groups other than the ones for which the original EBI was designed.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are a lot of online programs that colleges use to try to prevent sexual violence, especially during student orientation. Many of these programs are only one session or only cover topics like legal definitions of sexual assault and knowledge about consent. A new web-based program evaluated at Georgia State University covered these topics, but it also incorporated information about social norms, bystander intervention, and more into six 30-minute sessions. The program used interactive activities and a serial drama that modeled desirable behaviors. It was theory-driven and addressed risk and protective factors. It was also rigorously evaluated, using a true experimental design, with random selection and assignment to the program or to a control group, which consisted of a web-based program on more generic health topics. Although the participants were limited to men at a large, urban, southern university, they were diverse in terms of race, grade point average, and other factors.</p>
<figure id="attachment_19051" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-19051" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/doctabu/291216582"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-19051 size-medium" src="http://www.preventconnect.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/laptop-300x195.png?x47887" alt="Image source: Flickr Creative Commons, Brian Moore" width="300" height="195" srcset="http://www.preventconnect.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/laptop-300x195.png 300w, http://www.preventconnect.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/laptop.png 900w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-19051" class="wp-caption-text">Image source: Flickr Creative Commons, Brian Moore</figcaption></figure>
<p>The web-based program, called RealConsent, showed some promise. In a follow-up survey six months after the study, men who had completed RealConsent reported better knowledge and attitudes than people in the control group on factors believed to lead to bystander intervention and to sexual assault perpetration. They showed better legal knowledge of sexual assault and rape, knowledge of effective consent, and intentions to intervene against rape-supportive attitudes and speech and sexually coercive behaviors; as well as less hostility toward women, acceptance of peers’ sexually coercive behavior, and hyper-gender ideology.</p>
<p>The study also measured actual behaviors, not just risk and protective factors. The RealConsent group was significantly more likely to report intervening against rape-supportive attitudes, speech, and behaviors, and significantly less likely to report perpetrating sexual assault than the control group.</p>
<p>There were some limitations to the study, though. Out of the 743 men who started the study and completed the program, only 215 made it all the way through the six-month follow-up survey. Similar numbers of participants dropped out of each group, and the researchers say that the people who dropped out of both groups were similar. Still, when so few participants made it the whole way through the study, it’s impossible to know if the people who did complete the study were different in some way that affected the results. It’s also hard to rely on self-report. It could be that after the RealConsent participants learned about legal definitions of rape and sexual assault, as well as about getting effective consent, they didn’t report any sexual coercion they perpetrated because they knew it was unacceptable.</p>
<p>Hopefully, there will be more evaluation of RealConsent and web-based programs like it in the future, so we can see if this program is good for students at other colleges and beyond. If more studies show that this multi-session, multi-topic web-based model is effective, it could be a great tool to reach large audiences with fewer resources.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Background: </strong>Bystander intervention approaches offer promise for reducing rates of sexual violence on college campuses. Most interventions are in-person small-group formats, which limit their reach and reduce their overall public health impact.<br />
<strong>Objective: </strong>This study evaluated the efficacy of RealConsent, a Web-based bystander approach to sexual violence prevention, in enhancing prosocial intervening behaviors and preventing sexual violence perpetration.<br />
<strong>Methods: </strong>A random probability sample of 743 male undergraduate students (aged 18 to 24 years) attending a large, urban university located in the southeastern United States was recruited online and randomized to either RealConsent (n=376) or a Web-based general health promotion program (n=367). Participants were surveyed online at baseline, postintervention, and 6-months postintervention. RealConsent was delivered via a password-protected Web portal that contained six 30-minute media-based and interactive modules covering knowledge of informed consent, communication skills regarding sex, the role of alcohol and male socialization in sexual violence, empathy for rape victims, and bystander education. Primary outcomes were self-reported prosocial intervening behaviors and sexual violence perpetration. Secondary outcomes were theoretical mediators (eg, knowledge, attitudes).<br />
<strong>Results: </strong>At 6-month follow-up RealConsent participants intervened more often (<em>P</em>=.04) and engaged in less sexual violence perpetration (<em>P</em>=.04) compared to controls. In addition, RealConsent participants reported greater legal knowledge of sexual assault (<em>P</em>&lt;.001), greater knowledge of effective consent (<em>P</em>&lt;.001), less rape myths (<em>P</em>&lt;.001), greater empathy for rape victims (<em>P</em>&lt;.001), less negative date rape attitudes (<em>P</em>&lt;.001), less hostility toward women (<em>P</em>=.01), greater intentions to intervene (<em>P</em>=.04), less hyper-gender ideology (<em>P</em>&lt;.001), less positive outcome expectancies for nonconsensual sex (<em>P</em>=.03), more positive outcome expectancies for intervening (<em>P</em>&lt;.001), and less comfort with other men’s inappropriate behaviors (<em>P</em>&lt;.001).<br />
<strong>Conclusions: </strong>Our results support the efficacy of RealConsent. Due to its Web-based format, RealConsent has potential for broad-based dissemination thereby increasing its overall public health impact on sexual violence.</p></blockquote>

					<description><![CDATA[A 2014 study from the United Kingdom shows stark differences in the occurrence and consequences of domestic and sexual violence victimization&#160;&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 2014 study from the United Kingdom shows stark differences in the occurrence and consequences of domestic and sexual violence victimization in the adult lives of people with severe mental illness (SMI), compared to the general population. Severe mental illness was defined in this study as having mental disorders that qualify them for having designated caseworkers from state health services. The researchers were able to survey a random sample of almost 300 people with SMI for the study, and the comparison with the general population came from a nationally representative sample of over 22,000 people.</p>
<p>You can see in the chart below the differences between rates for people with SMI (patients) and for the general population (controls). The study looked at how many people had experienced domestic violence and sexual assault since they were 16 years old, as well as in the past year alone.</p>
<figure id="attachment_19020" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-19020" style="width: 456px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-19020" src="http://www.preventconnect.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/SMI-chart.png?x47887" alt="Image source: Khalifeh et al., 2014" width="456" height="243" srcset="http://www.preventconnect.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/SMI-chart.png 552w, http://www.preventconnect.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/SMI-chart-300x159.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 456px) 100vw, 456px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-19020" class="wp-caption-text">Image source: Khalifeh et al., 2014</figcaption></figure>
<p>Among people who had experienced severe sexual assault (SSA), which the study defined as nonconsensual penetration or oral sex, people with SMI were also more likely to experience many kinds of negative effects than the general population. People with SMI were significantly more likely to have mental or emotional problems, difficulty sleeping, depression, mistrust of others, stopping going out, and attempting suicide. They were also more likely to have physical injuries from bruises to broken bones, pregnancy, and sexually transmitted infections, but this difference was not statistically significant.</p>
<p>Just to give you a clearer picture of what these consequences looked like, <strong>91.8%</strong> of people with SMI had adverse psychological consequences after SSA, as compared to 64.2% of the general population. And <strong>53.1%</strong> of these people with SMI attempted suicide as a result of SSA, as opposed to 3.4% of the general population.</p>
<p>What does this mean for prevention? Though this information came from Britain, it is probably safe to assume that there are similar trends in the United States. People with SMI appear to be extremely vulnerable to sexual and domestic violence, and they also have higher rates of severe health problems after SSA. First of all, we need more research about the special risk and protective factors for this population, so we know more about how to prevent sexual and domestic violence against them. Once we know more, some primary prevention efforts should clearly be targeted toward people who live with, care for, and regularly interact with people with SMI.</p>

<p><strong>Full abstract:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Background</strong>. Domestic and sexual violence are significant public health problems but little is known about the extent to which men and women with severe mental illness (SMI) are at risk compared with the general population. We aimed to compare the prevalence and impact of violence against SMI patients and the general population.</p>
<p><strong>Method</strong>. Three hundred and three randomly recruited psychiatric patients, in contact with community services for 51 year, were interviewed using the British Crime Survey domestic/sexual violence questionnaire. Prevalence and correlates of violence in this sample were compared with those from 22606 general population controls participating in the contemporaneous 2011/12 national crime survey.</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong>. Past-year domestic violence was reported by 27% v. 9% of SMI and control women, respectively [odds ratio (OR) adjusted for socio-demographics, aOR 2.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.7–4.0], and by 13% v. 5% of SMI and control men, respectively (aOR 1.6, 95% CI 1.0–2.8). Past-year sexual violence was reported by 10% v. 2.0% of SMI and control women respectively (aOR 2.9, 95% CI 1.4–5.8). Family (non-partner) violence comprised a greater proportion of overall domestic violence among SMI than control victims (63% v. 35%, p&lt;0.01). Adulthood serious sexual assault led to attempted suicide more often among SMI than control female victims (53% v. 3.4%, p&lt;0.001).</p>
<p><strong>Conclusions</strong>. Compared to the general population, patients with SMI are at substantially increased risk of domestic and sexual violence, with a relative excess of family violence and adverse health impact following victimization. Psychiatric services, and public health and criminal justice policies, need to address domestic and sexual violence in this at-risk group.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-19001 size-full" src="http://www.preventconnect.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/image001-1.jpg?x47887" alt="image001 (1)" width="200" height="259" />The National Sexual Violence Research Center (NSVRC) has released a user-friendly practitioner&#8217;s guide to a 2014 research article by Sarah DeGue et al. The original research article was a systematic review of the effectiveness of sexual violence primary prevention programs and strategies. According to DeGue et al.&#8217;s study, the only programs/strategies that have been demonstrated to be effective are Safe Dates, Shifting Boundaries, and the Violence Against Women Act of 1994. The article also identified some strategies that might be effective, even though evaluations haven&#8217;t been consistent enough to declare them definitely effective. Finally, the study found some programs to have no effect or even be potentially harmful.</p>

<p>A big area of interest in research over the past few years has been how school climate, and particularly school staff, can influence bullying and sexual harassment. A recent study by Dorothy Espelage, Joshua Polanin, and Sabina Low adds to this body of research by looking at the connections between student reports related to bullying and teachers’, staff’s, and administrators’ perceptions. The study used a wide variety of questions to measure students’ and adults’ perceptions of middle schools’ climates, including likelihood of student intervention, likelihood of staff intervention, perceptions of aggression as a problem at their school, the school’s commitment to bullying prevention, positive teacher-staff-student interactions, and gender equity or intolerance of sexual harassment.</p>
<p>Overall, the study found that adults’ perceptions corresponded well to students’ perceptions. For example, when staff was perceived as likely to intervene to help victimized youth, students reported greater willingness to intervene in similar situations themselves. This is a great example of how the school climate and community can create norms to help prevent bullying, and specifically how important adults’ role is in building these norms. Teachers and administrators who take action to support prevention can have a big impact.</p>
<p>Importantly, the study also showed an association between staff reporting higher levels of gender equity and intolerance of sexual harassment, and students reporting lower bullying, lower bullying victimization, lower aggression, and higher willingness for students to intervene. It’s not really clear how the relationship between bullying, gender equity, and sexual harassment works, but this is yet another study showing that there is some sort of link. Reducing bullying seems to be an important way to affect sexual violence risk factors and sexual harassment, especially during early adolescence.</p>

<p><strong>Full abstract: </strong>This study examines how teacher and staff perceptions of the school environment correlate with student self-reports of bullying, aggression, victimization, and willingness to intervene in bullying incidents using multi-informant, multilevel modeling. Data were derived from 3,616 6th grade students across 36 middle schools in the Midwest, who completed survey measures of bullying, aggression, victimization, and willingness to intervene in bullying situations. Teachers and staff (n = 1,447) completed a school environment survey. Bivariate associations between school-level and student self-reports indicated that as teacher and staff perceive aggression as a problem in their school, students reported greater bully perpetration, fighting, peer victimization, and less willingness to intervene. Further, as staff and teacher report greater commitment to prevent bullying and viewed positive teacher and student relationships, there was less bullying, fighting, and peer victimization, and greater willingness to intervene. In a model where all school environment scales were entered together, a school commitment to prevent bullying was associated with less bullying, fighting, and peer victimization. Student-reports of bully perpetration and peer victimization were largely explained by staff and teacher commitment to bully prevention, whereas fighting and willingness to intervene were largely explained by student characteristics (e.g., gender). We conclude that efforts to address bullying and victimization should involve support from the school administration. School psychologists should play an active role in the school climate improvement process, by creating a school climate council consisting of students, parents, and teachers; administering school climate measures; identifying specific school improvement targets from these data, and engaging all stakeholders in the ongoing school improvement plan.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Today, the CDC released a new data set for the Prevalence and Characteristics of Sexual Violence, Stalking, and Intimate Partner&#160;&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/images/nisvs-infographic-web.jpg" class="broken_link"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-18960 size-medium" src="http://www.preventconnect.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/short-280x300.png?x47887" alt="short" width="280" height="300" srcset="http://www.preventconnect.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/short-280x300.png 280w, http://www.preventconnect.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/short.png 790w" sizes="(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px" /></a>Today, the CDC released a new data set for the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss6308a1.htm?s_cid=ss6308a1_e" target="_blank"><em>Prevalence and Characteristics of Sexual Violence, Stalking, and Intimate Partner Violence Victimization – National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey</em></a> for 2011.</p>
<p>The new report contains similar findings to the previous NISVS data sets, which suggests that the survey’s measures are reliable.This information highlights the prevalence of sexual violence and is critical as we continue our sexual violence prevention efforts.</p>
<p>A few key findings from the report, which you will find are consistent with the 2010 NISVS data, include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nearly 1 in 5 women (19%) and 1 in 59 men (nearly 2%) in the U.S. have been raped at some time in their lives.</li>
<li>One in 5 women (22%) and 1 in 7 men (14%) reported experiencing severe physical violence by an intimate partner in their lifetime.</li>
<li>One in 7 women (15%) and 1 in 18 men (6%) have experienced stalking victimization during their lifetime in which they felt very fearful or believed that they or someone close to them would be harmed or killed. Much of stalking victimization was facilitated by technology (i.e., unwanted phone calls and text messages).</li>
<li>Among women who have been raped and men who have been made to penetrate a perpetrator, 4 in 10 women (40%) and 1 in 5 men (21%) first experienced that type of victimization before age 18, and 4 in 5 women (79%) and 7 in 10 men (71%) were first victimized before age 25.</li>
</ul>
<p>Findings from this report can be used to help demonstrate that sexual violence, intimate partner violence, and stalking create a considerable public health burden, and can help identify priority target populations for prevention. Specifically, the data confirms the importance of efforts that focus on preventing these types of violence against young people.</p>
<p>In March 2014, PreventConnect hosted a series of web conferences to review this study in greater detail. Check out recordings of these PreventConnect web conferences about NISVS where you can hear from the researchers and advocates discussing the implications of the findings of previous versions of the report:</p>

<p>I’ve been wanting to write a post about the impact of neighborhood conditions on sexual violence for a while now, and it&#8217;s going to be a long one.</p>
<p>As a public health person, I’ve been reading about how important neighborhoods are to health for years. <a href="http://www.rwjf.org/content/dam/farm/reports/issue_briefs/2011/rwjf70450" target="_blank">Neighborhood factors</a> can make residents more or less likely to suffer a <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/ibs/pop/boardman/articles/2004_Boardman_SS%26M.pdf" target="_blank">range of health problems</a>, from higher rates of chronic disease and obesity-related disease, to poorer mental health, to increased rates of <a href="http://hsb.sagepub.com/content/49/2/131.short" target="_blank" class="broken_link">asthma</a>, to engagement in <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953614003967" target="_blank">risky health behaviors</a>. <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/277/5328/918.short" target="_blank">Neighborhoods</a> have also been shown to have important <a href="http://ccj.sagepub.com/content/20/2/127.short" target="_blank" class="broken_link">effects on many types of violence</a>. <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1741-3737.2002.00833.x/abstract;jsessionid=C252C60E725E9AE85E08DF10E0846CB9.f01t04?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&amp;userIsAuthenticated=false" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Studies</a> have <a href="http://www.annalsofepidemiology.org/article/S1047-2797(00)00052-1/abstract" target="_blank">shown</a> an association between intimate partner violence and child maltreatment and neighborhood-level factors, like high unemployment, social disadvantage, residents’ perceived level of <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19297887" target="_blank">neighborhood problems</a>, and neighbors’ <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/intimatepartnerviolence/riskprotectivefactors.html" target="_blank">willingness</a> to intervene in violence. They have also <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0145213414002555" target="_blank">shown</a> that programs that seek to improve neighborhood conditions can prevent some of these kinds of violence.</p>
<p>We also know that sexual violence <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/ncipc/pub-res/research_agenda/07_violence.htm" target="_blank" class="broken_link">shares</a> several risk and protective <a href="http://www.purdue.edu/incsapp/resources/organizations/VirginiaGuidelines.pdf" target="_blank" class="broken_link">factors</a> with other kinds of violence, such as rigid gender roles, the “isms,” strength of community sanctions for violence, absence or presence of healthy relationship role models, etc. So it seems possible that neighborhood factors could impact rates of sexual violence. There has not been very much research about this question, but a <a href="http://www.urban.org/uploadedpdf/411974_place_matters.pdf" target="_blank">report</a> from the Urban Institute has some interesting insights about how neighborhood settings and sexual violence might be related. The report talks about the decade-long <a href="http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/programdescription/mto" target="_blank">Moving to Opportunity</a> study, in which some families living in public housing in high-poverty, “chronically disadvantaged” neighborhoods were supported to move to affordable housing in low-poverty neighborhoods. It’s important to note that nothing about the families’ socioeconomic statuses changed because of the study; families just moved from one neighborhood to another.</p>
<p>The studies were looking for changes in mental health and risky behaviors in adolescents, and found “dramatic improvements” for adolescent girls, but not for boys. Based on interviews with these girls, one potential explanation was that for girls, moving to a low-poverty neighborhood meant “a profound reduction in fear of sexual harassment, coercion, and violence.” They “theorize that certain high poverty neighborhoods are characterized by a coercive sexual environment,” where adolescent girls (and probably women more generally) are exposed to high risk of sexual harassment and coercion.</p>
<p>But what about all the girls and women who were not able to move away from the high-poverty, disadvantaged neighborhoods? Can the sexually coercive environment they live in be changed? Can programs at a neighborhood level reduce rates of sexual harassment and sexual violence? There’s so much more we’d need to know about which neighborhood factors create these sexually coercive environments, and how those factors can be changed. Perhaps things like <a href="http://eab.sagepub.com/content/22/1/27.abstract" target="_blank" class="broken_link">neighborhood cohesion</a> (strong social networks, a sense of community, neighbors helping each other), <a href="http://www.uky.edu/~eushe2/Pajares/effbook11.html" target="_blank">collective efficacy</a> (belief in the group’s ability to organize and make changes), or residents’ perception of neighborhood safety could be important here. A subsequent <a href="http://uar.sagepub.com.libproxy.lib.unc.edu/content/45/6/715" target="_blank">article</a> on this study from 2013 did explore the girls’ and their parents’ experience of trying to stay safe in sexually coercive environments, but did not really focus on these questions.</p>
<p>What does your experiential evidence as a prevention practitioner tell you? How do you think neighborhood sexually coercive environments are created? Do you think that neighborhood-level risk and protective factors, like neighborhood cohesion, stability, collective efficacy, poverty, and general levels of violence, have something to do with it? Do you think there are any changes that could be made in a neighborhood that would help prevent at least some kinds of sexual violence? Is sexual violence too pervasive and widespread to address at a neighborhood level, or could this be an important piece of the puzzle?</p>

<p>In an observational study of 14 year olds, Maria do Mar Pereira, deputy director of the University of Warwick’s <a href="http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/sociology/rsw/research_centres/gender/" class="broken_link">Centre for the Study of Women and Gender</a>, observed girls restricting their behavior so that they could appear “more feminine” (i.e. avoiding physical activity and putting themselves on diets) and boys facing pressure to behave in ways that proved “their manliness” (i.e. fighting, drinking unhealthy amounts of alcohol, suppressing emotions).  The study concludes that:</p>
<blockquote><p>…this constant effort to manage one’s everyday life in line with gender norms produces significant anxiety, insecurity, stress and low self-esteem for both boys and girls, and both for ‘popular’ young people and those who have lower status in school.</p></blockquote>
<p>And, surprise, surprise – the teens studied <em>did not like</em> that they were expected to follow these gender roles. In an article about the study, Pereira recalls sharing the results of the study with the teens. They were shocked! Learning that their peers felt the same way and were also performing based on gendered expectations, their <em>behaviors changed</em>. They stopped mocking each other for not filling the expected gender roles, there was less fighting, and more.</p>
<p>In addition to the obvious link between gendered norms and sexual and domestic violence, this study also suggests something positive – we can do something to change harmful norms around gender. As Pereira pointed out in an interview about the study:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sometimes adults think it’s impossible to change gender norms because they’re already so deeply entrenched. But they’re much more entrenched in adults than they are in young people&#8230;It’s actually fairly easy to reach young people if you create opportunities for discussion, if you get them to think about their own experiences.</p></blockquote>

<p>A <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/aap/5/2/106/" target="_blank">new study</a> has brought up interesting questions for me about the tried and true strategy of prevention education for youth. Prevention education staff at the Sexual Abuse Treatment Center in Hawai’i created a curriculum called <em>Respect</em>, which used materials, content, and language relevant to the schools’ diverse student populations. The curriculum successfully improved student knowledge, attitudes, and self-efficacy to intervene as bystanders. What was really distinctive about this program, though, was that instead of delivering a prevention curriculum directly to students, the prevention education staff trained school staff to teach the curriculum themselves.</p>
<p>According to the study, this approach could help the curriculum to become a standard part of health education classes. This would have the added benefit that, “given the struggles that many communities face in funding prevention efforts, it [is] advantageous to create a curriculum that could be taught by a variety of individuals within existing institutions, not simply by outside experts in the field.” The study also mentions that having teachers and counselors deliver the curricula can leverage the existing relationships between school staff and students to improve students’ acceptance of the ideas in the curriculum.</p>
<p>While the article started to explain why this train-the-trainer approach could be beneficial, they didn’t evaluate whether or how having school staff teach the curriculum affected the success of the program. I think these could really be the key questions about this approach, and I think training the trainer could be important for a lot of reasons. Theoretically, having school staff teach could increase their understanding of and buy-in to prevention messages. In this study, only one teacher was trained to deliver the curriculum. But what if multiple counselors and teachers at every grade level completed a training and delivered the curriculum? Would they be more invested in preventing sexual violence? Would teachers and counselors become more involved as active bystanders themselves? Would they shape the school climate to be less tolerant of or indifferent to sexual harassment and assault? Could they even change the school environment and social norms? For me, the answer is an enthusiastic maybe!</p>

<p><strong>Full Abstract:</strong> Sexual violence is a significant public health problem with potential long-term consequences for victims. Prior research suggests that adolescents are at increased risk for sexual violence, which makes prevention education programs critical for this age group. However, there are few prevention programs that specifically target sexual violence, and even fewer that are culturally appropriate for Hawai‘i’s diverse population. This pilot study addresses these two gaps by implementing and evaluating a culturally grounded school-based sexual violence prevention curriculum. The <em>Respect</em> curriculum was developed by the Sex Abuse Treatment Center (a statewide social service agency with expertise in sexual violence prevention and treatment), in collaboration with the Hawai‘i Department of Education, teachers, counselors, and students across the state. A train-the-trainer model was used for implementation, in which teachers were trained and supported in teaching the curriculum to their students. One high school on Oahu served as the intervention school, with a demographically similar high school serving as the comparison. The sample was comprised of 136 students: 63 in the intervention school and 73 in the comparison school. Results showed that students in the intervention school significantly increased their knowledge of sexual violence, decreased their victim-blaming attitudes, and increased their bystander self-efficacy (i.e., their likelihood of acting on behalf of a potential victim if a situation arose) compared with students in the comparison school. Findings provide preliminary support for the utility of a train-the-trainer model in addressing sensitive health topics.</p>

<p>Have you ever tried to find good research or best practices for preventing violence against people with disabilities? Did you end up frustrated and empty-handed? If so, you’re not alone. In a new research article, Christopher Mikton, Holly Maguire, and Tom Shakespeare did a systematic review of the research on violence prevention for people with disabilities, and they specifically wanted to look at studies that evaluated how effective <a href="http://wiki.preventconnect.org/Primary%2C+Secondary%2C+Tertiary+Prevention" target="_blank">primary and secondary prevention</a> efforts were for this population.</p>
<p>They found some practice guides, like <em><a href="http://kc.vanderbilt.edu/kennedy_files/ProtectingChildrenwithDisabilitiesfromSexualAssaultAParentsGuide.pdf" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Protecting Children with Disabilities from Sexual Assault: A Parent’s Guide</a> </em>and <a href="http://www.researchgate.net/publication/258224697_Childhood_Disability__Violence._Empowering_disability_organisations_to_develop_prevention_strategies" target="_blank"><em>Childhood, Disability &amp; Violence</em></a>, which both make recommendations for violence prevention based on practitioners’ experiences, not on research. While it is great that these guidelines are based in real practice, it would be nice if there were also a body of research-based evidence to support them.</p>
<p>Even though the researchers looked for studies that evaluated the effectiveness of <em>any</em> kind of prevention efforts for people with <em>any</em> kind of disability in <em>any</em> country, they only found 10 studies that fit their criteria. Based on pre-set standards, the article deemed that all 10 of these studies were weak in their research methods, and <em>none</em> of them found that the prevention strategies they studied were effective.</p>
<p>Though this study clearly shows that the research world is way behind on preventing violence against people with disabilities, hopefully it will serve as a wake-up call to researchers. <strong>If you’ve had some good violence prevention experiences with people with disabilities, it could be worth connecting with Mikton, Maguire, and Shakespeare.</strong> I’m sure this article will generate interest in new research on this topic, and you might be able to help inform some of that research.</p>

<p><strong>Full Abstract:</strong> Persons with disabilities make up some 15% of the world’s population and are at higher risk of violence. Yet there is currently no systematic review of the effectiveness of interventions to prevent violence against them. Thus the aim of this review was to systematically search for, appraise the quality of, and synthesize the evidence for the effectiveness of interventions to prevent and mitigate the consequences of all the main forms of interpersonal violence against people with all types of disabilities. The method used consisted of searches of eleven electronic databases, hand searches of three journals, scanning of reference lists of review articles, contact with experts, appraisal of risk of bias using the Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies, and narrative synthesis of results. This resulted in 736 titles being identified, 10 of which met the inclusion criteria and 6 and 2 addressed people with intellectual disabilities and developmental disabilities, respectively. Only one was from a low- and middle-income country. All studies received a weak rating on the quality assessment tool and none could be considered effective after taking risk of bias into account. In sum, the current evidence base offers little guidance to policy makers, program commissioners, and persons with disabilities for selecting interventions. More and higher quality research is required, particularly from low- and middle-income countries and on other forms of disability such as physical impairments, sensory impairments, and mental health conditions.</p>

One of the major advantages a local agency can have in preventing sexual violence is knowing the communities they serve, so they can tailor their work to the community’s culture. There are lots of different ways to consider culture when you’re planning your prevention approaches. I found the 2014 article, &#8220;<a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10935-013-0334-z">A continuum of approaches toward prevention interventions: From adaptation to grounding</a>&#8221; by Scott Okamoto and colleagues, and I think it does a great job of laying out the benefits and challenges of several methods of balancing evidence and culture.</p>
<p>The article talks about surface- and deep-structure cultural changes to existing prevention programs and strategies, which can range from translating materials from an evidence-based intervention into another language to working with community members to highlight core cultural values in a curriculum. These are the most common ways that people have considered culture in prevention so far, and they both make the evidence-based approaches more relevant and accessible to the communities they serve. But both of these approaches still might miss some key cultural issues that are preventing positive change.</p>
<p>The authors of this article have been working on developing an approach they call “culturally grounded prevention.” This approach involves using “methods that place the culture and social context of the targeted population at the center of the intervention” by developing the program from the “ground up” while still based on demonstrated prevention component. “Rather than adapting prevention curricular components from one population to another, they build the evidence base within the communities and cultures that are intended to be served.” This approach takes a lot of time and resources, but it might just create the most culturally appropriate prevention programs, especially when you’re working with a population that hasn’t been studied or evaluated enough in the past.</p>
<p>Different levels of cultural adaptation are useful in different situations. The article challenges us to think about how to balance evidence, fidelity, and resource constraints with cultural fit and specificity.</p>
<p>Do you think the community you serve could benefit from more culturally grounded prevention work?</p>

<p><strong>Link:</strong> http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10935-013-0334-z</p>
<p><strong>Full Abstract:</strong> The purpose of this article is to describe a conceptual model of methods used to develop culturally focused interventions. We describe a continuum of approaches ranging from non-adapted/surface-structure adapted programs to culturally grounded programs, and present recent examples of interventions resulting from the application of each of these approaches. The model has implications for categorizing culturally focused prevention efforts more accurately, and for gauging the time, resources, and level of community engagement necessary to develop programs using each of the different methods. The model also has implications for funding decisions related to the development and evaluation of programs, and for planning of participatory research approaches with community members.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[In the sexual violence prevention field, one of the things we are always asking ourselves is why people commit sexually&#160;&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure style="width: 530px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.preventconnect.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/ACEs_Page_3.jpg?x47887"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.preventconnect.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/ACEs_Page_3.jpg?x47887" alt="" width="530" height="543" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">vetoviolence.cdc.gov</figcaption></figure>
<p>In the sexual violence prevention field, one of the things we are always asking ourselves is why people commit sexually violent acts. The answers are multiple and complicated, but a recent study by Levenson, Willis, and Prescott (2014) in Sex Abuse: A Journal of Research and Treatment reveals that male sex offenders in treatment programs are significantly more likely to report having a variety of adverse childhood experiences (<a title="Infographic: How adverse childhood experiences affect our lives and society" href="http://www.preventconnect.org/2013/03/infographic-how-adverse-childhod-experience-affect-our-lives-and-society/" target="_blank">ACEs</a>) than males in the general population.</p>
<p>The 679 male sex offenders in the study were more likely to have been verbally abused, physically abused, sexually abused, emotionally neglected, and physically neglected, as children than are males in the general population. They were also more likely to come from “dysfunctional homes,” in which their families dealt with domestic violence, substance abuse, mental illness, and incarceration. The more of these ACEs the sex offenders in the study reported having, the more likely they were to have victims who were younger than 12 and to have been convicted of sexual offenses that were violent, involved a weapon, and resulted in injuries for the victim.</p>
<p>This is not to say, of course, that ACEs cause people to be sexually violent, or that most people who experience ACEs become sex offenders. But it does suggest that ACEs might contribute to the conditions that encourage coercive sexual behavior.  Levenson, Willis, and Prescott point out, “an adverse family environment is a fertile breeding ground for sexual offending. Abuse, neglect, and family dysfunction often lead to mistrust, hostility, and insecure attachment, which then contribute to social rejection, loneliness, negative peer associations, and delinquent behavior.”</p>
<p>So what does this mean for sexual violence prevention professionals? How can we think about addressing the broader social contexts that lead to sexual violence? And how might incorporating responses to these traumatic experiences in sex offender treatment programs help prevent recidivism and additional sexual violence?</p>

<p><strong>Full Abstract:</strong> &#8220;This study explored the prevalence of childhood trauma in a sample of male sexual offenders (<em>N</em> = 679) using the Adverse Childhood Experience (ACE) scale. Compared with males in the general population, sex offenders had more than 3 times the odds of child sexual abuse (CSA), nearly twice the odds of physical abuse, 13 times the odds of verbal abuse, and more than 4 times the odds of emotional neglect and coming from a broken home. Less than 16% endorsed zero ACEs and nearly half endorsed four or more. Multiple maltreatments often co-occurred with other types of household dysfunction, suggesting that many sex offenders were raised within a disordered social environment. Higher ACE scores were associated with higher risk scores. By enhancing our understanding of the frequency and correlates of early adverse experiences, we can better devise trauma-informed interventions that respond to the clinical needs of sex offender clients.&#8221;</p>

I&#8217;ve found this experience of research being used as a tool to explain an absolute to be very fascinating. Let me be clear, I am the first person to find value in researching a process, concept, ideal, or mechanism for change. I am not in favor of being back in a place where, &#8220;This is how it&#8217;s been done&#8221;, was used to promote programs that are ineffective for communities. What I&#8217;ve become weary of is research becoming sacrosanct and critical analysis of the process one uses to gather data and the subsequent body of research created not getting questioned. This is of course in part influenced by the fact that as a Social Worker I&#8217;ve worked in communities research has not touched. Instead, models of practice have been imposed upon them that are not reflective of their unique socioeconomic and cultural experiences.</p>
<p>What I&#8217;d like to hear is a combination of what research may imply and what information still needs to be gathered. I&#8217;d love to have a conversation in which someone points out not only the data that has been gathered but what still needs to found out. I&#8217;d dance a little jig of happiness if the next time an evidence based curriculum was referred to, folks would acknowledge &#8220;perfect&#8221; models can&#8217;t always be applied to society&#8217;s not so &#8220;perfect&#8221; people. I don&#8217;t want to dismantle the whole system, I&#8217;d just like to make sure what the research is saying has meaning for everyone.</p>

<blockquote><p>Young women overwhelmingly depicted boys and men as <em>natural</em> sexual aggressors, pointing to one of the main tenets of compulsory heterosexuality.</p></blockquote>
<p>The article discusses the findings through the lens of compulsory heterosexuality and heteronormativity – “traditional gender arrangements, beliefs, and behavior [that] reinforce women’s sexual subordination to men.”  Importantly, it reviews the discourse on children, sexuality, and sexual abuse since the 1970s, demonstrating how such normalization of violence came to be.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract: </strong></p>
<p>Despite high rates of gendered violence among youth, very few young women report these incidents to authority figures. This study moves the discussion from the question of why young women do not report them toward how violence is produced, maintained, and normalized among youth. The girls in this study often did not name what law, researchers, and educators commonly identify as sexual harassment and abuse. How then, do girls name and make sense of victimization? Exploring violence via the lens of compulsory heterosexuality highlights the relational dynamics at play in this naming process. Forensic interviews with youth revealed patterns of heteronormative scripts appropriated to make sense of everyday harassment, violence, coercion, and consent. Findings inform discussions about the links between dominant discourses and sexual subjectivities as we try to better understand why many regard violence a normal part of life.</p>

<p>As we seek strategies to prevent rape, we need to examine not only how to prevent sexual violence victimization, but we need strategies to prevent sexual violence perpetration. And to develop strategies to prevent sexual violence perpetration, we need to know about the perpetrators themselves. Yet, little information is known about youth perpetrators. A <a href="http://archpedi.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1748355" target="_blank">recent study in JAMA Pediatrics</a> provides new insight. The study found that nearly 1 in 10 youths reported some type of sexual violence perpetration in their lifetimes. Join one of the study&#8217;s authors to discuss the study and to explore implications for prevention.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Sexual and domestic violence prevention work is social change work.  To successfully create social change we must also overcome resistance&#160;&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.preventconnect.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Screen-Shot-2013-10-09-at-4.42.50-PM.png?x47887"><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-18323" style="margin: 5px;" alt="Cover of European Journal of Social Psychology" src="http://www.preventconnect.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Screen-Shot-2013-10-09-at-4.42.50-PM.png?x47887" width="95" height="137" /></a>Sexual and domestic violence prevention work is social change work.  To successfully create social change we must also overcome resistance to it.  Attempting to understand the resistance, studies typically look at individual perceptions of the issues addressed, attitudes towards social change, and personality traits, but <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ejsp.1983/abstract" target="_blank" class="broken_link">a new study</a> in the European Journal of Social Psychology takes a different approach, turning the lens to activists:</p>
<blockquote><p>Because activists, by definition, strive to effect change by publicly criticizing mainstream practices, they may be seen as hostile, unconventional and unpleasant. This tendency to associate activists with negative stereotypes may ultimately reduce individuals’  willingness to affiliate with activists and adopt the pro-change behaviours that activists espouse.</p></blockquote>
<p>This five-part study found that participants who held negative perceptions of activists were less willing to affiliate with them and to adopt the behaviors they promoted.  For example, one portion of the study that focused specifically on feminist activists found:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;participants were less motivated to adopt pro-equality behaviours when these behaviours were ostensibly advocated by the <b>‘</b> typical<b>’ </b> feminist rather than when these same behaviours were advocated by the <b>‘</b> atypical<b>’ </b> feminist or the undefined target, because participants were more likely to associate the <b>‘</b> typical<b>’ </b> feminist with negative stereotypical traits. Thus, despite aggressively promoting social change, <b>‘</b> typical<b>’ </b>activists may, ironically, undermine individuals<b>’ </b> motivation to engage in pro-change behaviours.</p></blockquote>
<p>Stereotypes played a big role in this research; they fostered negative perceptions of activists.  Most often, activists who were identified as &#8220;typical&#8221; (and therefore negatively perceived) were  viewed as eccentric and militant or aggressive.</p>
<blockquote><p>For many activists, the willingness to take a radical stand without regard for mainstream sensibilities is a point of pride&#8230;Ironically and despite good intentions, therefore, the very individuals who are most actively engaged in promoting social change may inadvertently alienate members of the public and reduce pro-change motivation.</p></blockquote>
<p>It is indeed ironic that the our very passion as activists may diminish our effectiveness in creating change and engaging others.  As disappointing as this is, this research acknowledges the difficulties many of us have faced in making our messages engaging to our audiences, shifting the lens to provide additional insight into barriers we may encounter.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.preventconnect.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Lancet-global-Health.gif?x47887"><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-18314" alt="Lancet GLobal Health covet" src="http://www.preventconnect.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Lancet-global-Health.gif?x47887" width="112" height="150" /></a>As we seeking strategies to prevent rape, we need to examine not only how to prevent sexual violence victimization, but  we need strategies to prevent sexual violence perpetration. And to develop strategies to prevent sexual violence perpetration, we need to know about the perpetrators themselves.</p>
<p>In the <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X%2813%2970074-3/abstract">recently released study published in the journal Lancet Global Health</a>, the researchers examined prevalence and factors associated with perpetration using data from interviews with 10,178 men from six countries in Asian and the Pacific.</p>
<p>The findings are disheartening: 24% of men committed rape against a partner or non-partner. (There was great variance among the countries ranging 11.1-60.7%).  In this research we hear from people who perpetrate rape themselves. Men who acknowledged that they had committed rape gave reasons for their actions:</p>
<blockquote><p>Of those who had raped a nonpartner woman (but not a man or a partner), the most common reason for the most recent rape expressed sexual entitlement (statements endorsed by 73% of men across the region; table 2), followed by entertainment seeking (59%), anger or punishment (38%), and alcohol or substance use (27%; table 2).</p></blockquote>
<p>The researchers also asked about the consequences of their action:</p>
<blockquote><p>…only 55% of men had felt guilty, and 23% had been sent to prison for rape of a partner or non-partner woman, or man (table 2), but this proportion varied from 2% (Sri Lanka) to 52% (Papua New Guinea), where traditional rape punishments are used, with short-term detention by the police in prison until traditional preparations have been made.</p></blockquote>
<p>While these samples are not nationally representative of those countries, nor able to be applied to the population, this provides  a stark picture of men who rape. Research exploring perpetration is necessary to understand how we can create change.</p>
<p>The researchers described the study as about “family and health” and. Instead of asking questions like “Have you ever raped someone? That asked behaviorally specific questions:</p>
<blockquote><p>The word rape was not used in the questionnaire; instead, it was operationalised through responses to questions about specific acts. Two questions about nonpartner rape asked about having “forced a woman who was not your wife or girlfriend at the time to have sex” or having “had sex with a woman who was too drunk or drugged to indicate whether she wanted it”, and how often the male interviewees had committed such acts. Two additional questions asked about having done these acts with other men (multiple perpetrator rape).</p></blockquote>
<p>For prevention practitioners, this type of research helps us understand perpetration in order to create prevention efforts that can make the necessary changes in communities that will contribute to preventing rape.</p>

This National Institute of Justice funded study conducted interviews with a national sample of 1525 Latino adolescents. 6.6% had experienced physical dating violence, 5.6% had experienced sexual dating violence, 1.0% had experienced stalking by a dating partner, and 14.8% had experienced psychological dating violence.</p>
<p>This study found that males reported higher rates of victimization than girls reported.  The researchers used questions from the Conflict Tactics Scale 2 which has been criticized. (see the <a href="http://new.vawnet.org/print-document.php?doc_id=388&amp;find_type=web_desc_AR" class="broken_link">VAWnet paper Measuring the Extent of Woman Abuse in Intimate Heterosexual Relationships: A Critique of the Conflict Tactics Scales</a> for details.)</p>
<p>In their findings, authors Chiara Sabina and Carlos Cuevas made recommendations for prevention among Latino adolescents:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;prevention efforts should focus on this form of dating violence and equip youth to identify and confront controlling actions, put-downs and jealously, for example. <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359178912000237">Shorey (2012)</a> recommends a psychoeducational component focused on psychological aggression and communication skills be included in prevention efforts. These programs should be adapted to the Latino population including language, idioms, how discrimination may play a role in dating violence, and the importance of family.</p></blockquote>

<p>Regarding privacy, the report shows that teens are sharing more information than ever online, but they are also aware of and skilled in using privacy settings on social media sites.  For example, 56% of teens reported that it was “not difficult at all” to manage the privacy settings on their Facebook pages.  Another 33% said doing so was “not too difficult.”</p>
<p>The report provides a number of interesting adjunctive materials, including two interactive features and four infographics.  And while it both confirms our movement’s concerns about the dangers of social media, it also demonstrates that teens are a lot more social media and tech saavy than we tend to give them credit for.  They know privacy is an issue and choose various ways to deal with it.</p>
<blockquote><p>Facebook is a major center of teenage social interactions, both with the positives of friendship and social support and the negatives of drama and social expectations.</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s clear from the report that teens both like and hate social media sites, especially Facebook. It defines their social lives and, in some cases, feels like an obligation.  So as we consider how to <a href="http://www.preventconnect.org/2012/10/prevention-how-state-local-health-departments-can-capitalize-on-social-media/" target="_blank">use social media</a> to <a href="http://www.preventconnect.org/2012/08/bystander-intervention-using-social-media-to-build-bystander-action-to-prevent-violence/" target="_blank">reach teens</a>, and as the trends change daily, reports like this become evermore important.</p>

<ul>
<li>The use of empowerment evaluation as a set of guiding principles</li>
<li>Operating from an intentional and rich theory base</li>
<li>Experimenting with strategies to promote inclusion</li>
<li>Application of a data driven planning process</li>
<li>The importance of building capacity</li>
</ul>
<p>While specific to two CDC grant programs, <i>Strengthening Systems to Prevent Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence</i>’s findings, examples, and insights can inform anyone doing sexual and domestic violence prevention work, at state and local levels.  For example, <i>Youth Action Strategies in the Primary Prevention of Teen Dating Violence</i> offers a comprehensive look at a local project to prevent teen dating violence in Wisconsin.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Description of the book (from Routledge)</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Over the past 25 years, developing coordinated responses to intimate partner violence and sexual violence has improved both perpetrator accountability, and victim safety and self-determination. However, preventing intimate partner violence and sexual violence from occurring is beyond the ability of any one type of organization. Preventing this violence requires a network of individuals, groups and organizations who coordinate and assess their efforts on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p>This volume provides theoretical and practical guidance for the development of state and local prevention systems that hold the potential to eliminate persistent social problems. The development of prevention systems was informed by the data-driven public health model, systems theory and the ecological systems perspective. <i>Strengthening Systems to Prevent Intimate Partner Violence and Sexual Violence</i> offers guidance on how to gain participation of the right partners in developing a prevention system, and how to focus the work of that system on the critical areas of planning, implementation and capacity building. The guidance, resources and experience shared in this important collection will be invaluable to all those working towards the prevention of intimate partner violence and sexual violence.</p>
<p>This book is based on a special issue of the <i>Journal of Family Social Work</i>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2013/5/9/behind_the_cleveland_kidnappings_a_culture" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-18034" style="margin: 5px;" alt="Jaclyn Friedman on TV" src="http://www.preventconnect.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Screen-Shot-2013-05-09-at-12.19.34-PM-300x167.png?x47887" width="300" height="167" srcset="http://www.preventconnect.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Screen-Shot-2013-05-09-at-12.19.34-PM-300x167.png 300w, http://www.preventconnect.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Screen-Shot-2013-05-09-at-12.19.34-PM.png 634w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Today on her <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jaclynf?fref=ts">Facebook page</a>, Jaclyn Friedman referred to the particularly “rapey news cycle” of late.  And that it is.  From <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/thecurrent/episode/2013/05/09/sexual-assault-and-the-us-military/">sexual assault in the military</a>, to the <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2013/5/9/behind_the_cleveland_kidnappings_a_culture">Cleveland kidnappings</a>, these stories have generated a renewed look at norms around masculinity and how they contribute to rape culture, a culture that ultimately produces the events that lead to such “rapey news cycles.”</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2013/5/9/behind_the_cleveland_kidnappings_a_culture">an interview</a> about the Cleveland kidnappings and rapes, Friedman stated that creating a world free of sexual violence, “requires cultural change and undoing toxic masculinity.”  Then, in <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/thecurrent/episode/2013/05/09/sexual-assault-and-the-us-military/">an interview</a> about the high rates of sexual assault in the military, she went on to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>The dominant paradigm of masculinity is that we’re living in and the culture is defined as masculinity is derived from power over women and it makes people very uncomfortable to suggest we have to do the work of creating new ways to create masculinity that’s power <i>with</i> women…</p></blockquote>
<p>Indeed, in the same interview, guests Angela Marie McDonald, discussing Vancouver’s <a href="http://www.theviolencestopshere.ca/dbtg.php" class="broken_link">Don’t Be That Guy</a> campaign, and <a href="http://www.politico.com/">Politico</a>’s Juana Summers call for culture change when asked just how one can prevent sexual violence in institutions such as the military.  “It’s very hard to culturally change an institution.  And that part can’t come from lawmakers,” Summers says about the military.</p>
<p>And <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11199-013-0268-1">new research</a> confirms the need for culture change, particularly around notions about masculinity.  Psychologists from the University of Manitoba studied advertisements in men’s magazines and found that they promoted the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Danger is exciting</li>
<li>Toughness is a form of emotional self-control</li>
<li>Violence is manly</li>
<li>It’s fine to be callous about women and sex</li>
</ul>
<p>These are hypermasculine beliefs, and as <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/07/be-a-man-macho-hypermasculine-advertising_n_3230402.html">Huffington Post points out</a>, “previous research has linked these beliefs to social and medical problems in men,” including violence against women.</p>
<p>So what can be done?  The news media has picked up on a key component of prevention violence against women – examining and changing harmful notions about what it means to be a man.  Read more about innovative initiatives to do just that on <a href="http://www.preventconnect.org/?s=masculinity">our blog</a>, learn about these norms on <a href="http://learn.preventconnect.org/course/view.php?id=18" class="broken_link">our eLearning site</a>, watch one of many <a href="http://www.preventconnect.org/2012/11/promoting-healthy-masculinity/">web conferences</a> about healthy masculinity, and <i>continue the conversation</i>.</p>

<p>Joan Tabachnick, David Prescott and Steven Bengis of NEARI Press summarize the research:</p>
<blockquote><p>The research clearly states that most children who are victimized by sexual abuse do not go on to sexually abuse others. However, the research findings did suggest that sexual victimization in boys over age 12 may be an important risk factor for this population.</p></blockquote>
<p>For prevention,  the NEARI News documents recommends universal education, especially for boys over twelve should be considered as an important prevention strategy.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Up to 30 percent of children experience childhood sexual abuse (CSA) and whether this impacts re-victimisation or offending as an adult has been the subject of numerous studies.</p>
<p>This study investigates whether a disproportionate number of CSA victims subsequently perpetrate offences and experience future victimisation compared with people who have not been sexually abused. In a sample of 2,759 CSA victims who were abused between 1964 and 1995, it was found CSA victims were almost five times more likely than the general population to be charged with any offence than their non-abused counterparts, with strongest associations found for sexual and violent offences. CSA victims were also more likely to have been victims of crime, particularly crimes of a sexual or violent nature.</p>
<p>This research highlights the need for therapeutic interventions targeted at adolescent male CSA victims, particularly with regard to offender treatment programs, where many programs currently do not allow for exploration of offenders’ own sexual victimisation.</p></blockquote>

<p>Here are some of the top innovations related to sexual and domestic violence prevention:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Connecting and Training Practitioners Online</strong>: With advances in technology, more an more resources are available online to build the capacity of prevention practitioners. PreventConnect is recognized as one of the online resources that has built a community of prevention practitioners. Other highlights included CDC’s <a href="http://www.vetoviolence.org" class="broken_link">VetoViolence</a> eLearning site, <a href="http://www.vawnet.org">VAWnet</a> and <a href="http://www.nsvrc.org">National Sexual Violence Resource Center</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Moving Upstream in Sexual and Intimate Partner Violence Prevention – RPE and DELTA</strong>.  IN the last 10 years CDC’s leading primary prevention initiatives have demonstrated the value of advancing primary prevention efforts. The <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=RedirectURL&amp;_method=externObjLink&amp;_locator=url&amp;_issn=00224375&amp;_origin=article&amp;_zone=art_page&amp;_plusSign=%2B&amp;_targetURL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fviolenceprevention%2Frpe%2Findex.html" class="broken_link">Rape Prevention Education Program</a> (RPE) and <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=RedirectURL&amp;_method=externObjLink&amp;_locator=url&amp;_issn=00224375&amp;_origin=article&amp;_zone=art_page&amp;_plusSign=%2B&amp;_targetURL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fviolenceprevention%2Fdelta%2Findex.html" class="broken_link">The Domestic Violence Prevention Enhancement and Leadership Through Alliances Program</a> (DELTA) aim to increase primary prevention of intimate partner (IPV) and sexual violence (SV) through capacity-building in states and communities.<strong></strong></li>
<li><strong>Engaging Boys and Men to Prevent Violence Against Women. </strong>Many organizations have developed approaches that engage boys and men as part of the solution to violence against women, and prevention more broadly, Examples include <a href="http://www.futureswithoutviolence.org/content/features/detail/811/" class="broken_link">Coaching Boys to Men</a>, <a href="http://www.mencanstoprape.org/The-Men-of-Strength-Club/" class="broken_link">Men of Strength Clubs</a> and organizations such as <a href="http://www.menstoppingviolence.org">Men Stopping Violence</a> and <a href="http://www.mensworkinc.com">MensWork</a>.</li>

<blockquote><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: This article presents what the authors consider to be among the top 20 practice innovations since the inception of the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control in 1992. The innovations embody various characteristics of successful public health programs and have contributed to declines in violence, motor vehicle, residential fire, and other injury rates over the past 20 years. Taken together, these innovations have reduced the burden of violence and injury and have influenced current practice and practitioners in the United States and worldwide.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>Popular crime dramas have tackled sensitive issues such as sexual assault with increasing frequency over the past 20 years. These popular programs increasingly demonstrate the emotional and physical effect of sexual assault on its victims, and in some instances they depict individuals being rewarded for intervening to prevent or stop an assault in progress. It is possible that this content could affect attitudes related to sexual assault prevention. However, no previous research has examined this possibility. In the fall 2008 semester, 508 undergraduates at a large northwestern university completed a questionnaire about media use and bystander intervention in a sexual assault situation. Results from hierarchical regressions lend support for the integrative model of behavioral prediction in that instrumentality, rape myth acceptance, perceived social norms, perceived efficacy related to intervening, and exposure to primetime crime dramas were associated with participants&#8217; intentions to intervene in a sexual assault. The results suggest that crime dramas may be a useful venue for prevention messages as exposure to crime dramas uniquely contributed to intentions to intervene in a sexual assault.</p>

<p>In the article, author Christopher Einolf theorizes that while women are more motivated to help than men, men’s greater social and human capital cancels this out, leading to little difference in men and women’s prosocial behaviors.  After examining the data, however, he concludes that overall, women are more prosocially motivated and men have only a small advantage in resources and social capital when it comes to volunteering and charitable giving.  Because men are not as proscially motivated as women, therefore, they may need more “hooks” to drawn them in for volunteering and charitable giving.</p>
<p>In reading this article, I thought of efforts to engage men in the prevention of sexual and domestic violence.  When local sexual and domestic violence programs, or other community-based organizations, work to engage men in their communities in the prevention of sexual and domestic violence, they are essentially asking for men’s volunteer time.  If they approach recruitment as they have for the countless women who have volunteered for the movement over the decades, they may be unsuccessful.  If, as this article posits, men are not as intrinsically motivated to volunteer for the cause as women are, they will have to do some very strategic thinking and planning to approach and engage men differently.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>Psychological research has found that women score higher on most measures of the traits, motivations, and values that predict helping others, and women are more likely to help family and friends. However, sex differences in the institutional helping behaviors of volunteering and charitable giving are small. This article seeks to explain this apparent contradiction with the hypotheses that men have more resources and more social capital than women, which compensates for their lower level of motivation. The article tests these hypotheses using data from the 1995 Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) survey. The data show partial support for these hypotheses, as men score higher on measures of income, education, trust, and secular social networks. However, women have broader social networks through religious participation.</p></blockquote>

<p>To prevent teen dating violence, we need to think about prevention efforts that go beyond classroom based strategies. It can be hard to get into classrooms (especially to provide multiple sessions that we know are more likely to prevent violence than single sessions.)</p>
<p>How can we work with parents and families to prevent teen dating violence? In my experience as a prevention practitioner and as a parent, I know parents are less involved than they were when their children were younger. Just if we could find a way to help parents and families to make a difference&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p><strong>Purpose</strong>: To examine the effects of a family-based teen dating abuse prevention program, Families for Safe Dates, primarily on outcomes related to testing the conceptual underpinnings of the program including (1) factors motivating and facilitating caregiver engagement in teen dating abuse prevention activities, and 2) risk factors for teen dating abuse, and secondarily on dating abuse behaviors.</p>
<p><strong>Methods</strong>: Families were recruited nationwide using listed telephone numbers. Caregivers and teens completed baseline and 3-month follow-up telephone interviews (n = 324). Families randomly allocated to treatment condition received the Families for Safe Dates program including six mailed activity booklets followed-up by health educator telephone calls.</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong>: There were significant (&lt;.05) treatment effects in hypothesized directions on most of the factors motivating and facilitating caregiver engagement in teen dating abuse prevention activities including caregiver perceived severity of dating abuse, response efficacy for preventing dating abuse, self-efficacy for talking about dating abuse, knowledge of dating abuse, acceptance of dating abuse, communication skills with the teen, and belief in the importance of involvement in their male (but not female) teen&#8217;s dating. The latter effect was the only one moderated by sex of the teen. The targeted risk factor affected by the program was teen acceptance of dating abuse. Treatment was also significantly associated with less physical dating abuse victimization.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusions</strong>: Modifications to the program are warranted, but overall, the findings are very favorable for the first family-based teen dating abuse prevention program to be evaluated.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I think for the benefits of bystander intervention, my thoughts initially turn to the positive impact that a bystander can have for a victim (or potential victim). Recent research suggests that bystanders may experience separate and distinct health impacts that deserve attention and focus from health care professionals, parents, teachers, and support networks. In <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22909907">&#8220;Morbidity among bystanders of bullying behavior at school: concepts, concerns, and clinical/research issues&#8221;, Ian Rivers</a> discusses the complexities of bystander behavior and how the social dynamics of bystander intervention can determine the long term sequele of an individual&#8217;s mental health. Rivers determined that &#8220;the mental health implications &#8230; vary according to the category or type of bystander a student becomes&#8221;, types ranging from those who support the bully or perpetrator to ones that actively fight for the rights of the victim. River&#8217;s conclusion:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is incumbent upon schools and those who administer schools to find ways of supporting the whole educational community rather than focusing their attention upon victims and perpetrators. Post-traumatic stress, internalized hostility, substance use, and suicide ideation are issues as commonly found among witnesses as they are among victims of assault, abuse, natural disasters, or man-made events<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22909907"> (Rivers, 2012)</a></p></blockquote>
<p>What are ways in which you support a bystander not only as the intervene but after the incident?</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>The role of the bystander is not one that is easily understood in the anti-bullying literature. Roles within the unofficial hierarchy of the school-yard and playground overlap considerably, and each role has its own social dynamic that brings with it a shifting behavioral landscape that affects every student. In this article, the mental health correlates of three categories of bystander are explored: the co-victim, the isolate, and the confederate. Each category of bystander has its own characterizations and mental health correlates. Reports of post-traumatic stress, internalized hostility, substance use, and suicide ideation are discussed with reference to studies involving witnesses of family abuse, community and school violence as well as bullying. It is argued that bystanders are the key to challenging bullying in schools, and their mental health and well-being is pivotal to the effectiveness of anti-bullying interventions.</p>

The  article describes the shared key fundamental elements and roots causes of both behaviors such creating a power differential within interpersonal relationships and what Albert Bandura calls &#8220;moral disengagement&#8221;. Moral disengagement is defined as, &#8220;a lack of self regulation regarding moral conduct&#8221;.

<blockquote><p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>Bullying is the use of power and aggression to control and distress another. In this paper, we review research to explore whether the lessons learned in bullying provide a stepping stone to aggressive behavior in dating relationships. We start by considering definitions and a relationship framework with which to understand both bullying and dating aggression. We consider bullying from a developmental-contextual perspective and consider risk factors associated with the typical developmental patterns for bullying and dating aggression, including developmental and sociodemographic, individual attributes, and family, peer group, community, and societal relationship contexts that might lead some children and youths to follow developmental pathways that lead to bullying and dating aggression. We conclude by discussing implications for intervention with a review of evidence-based interventions.</p></blockquote>

<p>According to the <a href="http://www.nsvrc.org/">National Sexual Violence Resource Center</a>, bystander intervention programs teach potential witnesses safe and positive ways that they can act to prevent or intervene when there is a risk for sexual violence. &#8220;A bystander approach gives community members specific roles that they can use in preventing sexual violence, including naming and stopping situations before they happen, stepping in during an incident, and speaking out against ideas and behaviors that support sexual violence. This approach develops skills to be an effective and supportive ally to survivors after an assault has taken place.&#8221;</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Teens are much more likely to report that using social media has a positive impact on their social and emotional lives than a negative one.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Overall, the study challenges several common assumptions those of us who work with youth often hold.  While the study confirmed that teens do have negative experiences related to social media use, it found that in general they are much more likely to report that social media has a positive impact on their lives.  I’ve often heard complaints from prevention educators that the only trainings they can find about youth and social media focus on how <em>bad </em>it is for them.  What about how <em>good</em> it is?  Those of us who work in prevention can use this new research to inform comprehensive prevention strategies that include multiple methods of communication for youth.  We can also help shift the discussion about media and technology to how it can be a useful prevention tool.</p>

Authors Bleakly, Jamieson, and Romer confirm what practitioners have known for years, that there are gender imbalances in the media and that repeated exposure to these imbalances, the sexual depiction of women, and the violent depiction of men impact young men and women&#8217;s normative beliefs about sexual behavior.</p>
<p>The analysis of the data showed that there are no quick fixes to this problem. As one researcher notes,</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;simply increasing the prevalence of women among characters in media might exacerbate any problematic effects of media unless the manner in which women are portrayed is also addressed.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not a matter of sheer volume, it is an issue of the characters that the women portray and minimizing the roles that perpetuate the stereotype of hyper-sexualized, one dimensional women. <span id="more-17162"></span>But this is not just an issue for women &#8211; the roles that we give men in mainstream media must also change.</p>
<p>&#8220;In contrast to women being disproportionately involved in sexual content, male characters are the overwhelming perpetrators of violence.&#8221;</p>
<p>Having males in limited roles in films translates into adolescent perceptions of limited roles in life. When mainstream media offers only two norms to fill, a sexualized female and a violent male, young people are robbed of their ability to step outside of gender norms and we perpetuate cultural values that support victim blaming, sexual assault, and rape myths.</p>
<p>What do you think are the best ways to influence media&#8217;s portrayal of women and men?</p>
<p>Abstract</p>
<p>Trends of Sexual and Violent Content by Gender in Top-Grossing U.S. Films, 1950–2006</p>
<p>Amy Bleakley, Ph.D., M.P.H., Patrick E. Jamieson, Ph.D., Daniel Romer, Ph.D.</p>
<p>Journal of Adolescent Health, Volume 51, Issue 1 , Pages 73-79, July 2012</p>
<p>Purpose: Because popular media such as movies can both reflect and contribute to changes in cultural norms and values, we examined gender differences and trends in the portrayal of sexual and violent content in top-grossing films from 1950 to 2006.</p>
<p>Methods: The sample included 855 of the top-grossing films released over 57 years, from 1950 to 2006. The number of female and male main characters and their involvement in sexual and violent behavior were coded and analyzed over time. The relationships between sexual and violent behavior within films were also assessed.</p>
<p>Results: The average number of male and female main characters in films has remained stable over time, with male characters outnumbering female characters by more than two to one. Female characters were twice as likely as male characters to be involved in sex, with differences in more explicit sex growing over time. Violence has steadily increased for both male and female characters.</p>
<p>Conclusions: Although women continue to be underrepresented in films, their disproportionate portrayal in more explicit sexual content has grown over time. Their portrayal in violent roles has also grown, but at the same rate as men. Implications of exposure to these trends among young movie-going men and women are discussed.</p>

Potter, PhD, MPH discusses an evaluation of the <a href="https://www.soteriasolutions.org/college" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&#8220;Know Your Power&#8221;</a> bystander oriented social marketing campaign. Her article &#8220;Using a Multimedia Social Marketing Campaign to Increase Active Bystanders on the College Campus&#8221; concluded that exposure to the &#8220;<a href="https://www.soteriasolutions.org/college" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Know Your Power&#8221;</a> social marketing campaign increased student awareness of their role in reducing violence as well as their self-reported expressed willingness to get involved in reducing violence as an active bystander. Potter and her team conducted pre- and posttests of 353 undergraduate students at a public college over a 6 month period, and assessed participant&#8217;s responses based on a stage of scale score.</p>
<p>Implementing a social marketing campaign can be relatively cost-effective and simple, and can increase awareness of a particular public health concern and inspire viewers to take action. As beneficial as social marketing can be, it cannot serve as a substitute for a comprehensive primary prevention program that integrates bystander intervention across multiple levels of the social ecological level. <span id="more-17111"></span>While individuals may feel inspired to take action, they may not have the skills or self-efficacy to take action. A community may increase it&#8217;s overall awareness of the issue and desire to reduce violence but if they do not feel as though they are able to step in and take action, we will not see a reduction in the number of sexual assaults in our community. My thought is that increasing individual skills coupled with a social marketing campaign would be the most effective strategy for increasing bystander activity as individuals would have the tools to intervene and feel supported by their community in taking that action. There may be populations that would be challenging to reach to teach the actual skills of intervening but once you are able to get a group of early adopters practicing the behavior, students who did not participate in the skills based training would have a model to replicate.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What do you feel are the most effective methods for increasing bystander behavior and reducing violence?</span></p>
<p>ABSTRACT:</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Using a Multimedia Social Marketing Campaign to Increase Active Bystanders on the College Campus&#8221; </strong>Sharyn Potter, PhD MPH<em> Journal of American College Health</em>, Vol. 60, No. 4, 2012, pg 282-295.</p>
<p><strong>Objective: </strong>To evaluate the campus-wide administration of the Know Your Power bystander-oriented social marketing campaign.</p>
<p><strong>Participants</strong>: Undergraduate students at a public college were invited to participate in a public awareness survey before and after the 6-week campaign administration in February and March 2009.</p>
<p><strong>Methods</strong>: Pretest and posttests were administered (<em>N </em>= 353) to examine if exposure to the campaign changed students’ stage of scale scores.</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong>: Exposure to the social marketing campaign increased participants’ awareness of their role in reducing sexual and relationship violence and stalking, increased their expressed willingness to get involved in reducing the incidence these types of violence, and resulted in participants being more likely to report having taken action to reduce these types of violence.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusions</strong>: As college students explore their role as community members, it is an opportunity for college educators to design and administer prevention messages highlighting behavioral norms to be explored and adopted.</p>

During the 12 months before the survey, 9.4% of students nationwide had been hit, slapped, or physically hurt on purpose by their boyfriend or girlfriend and 8% of students had ever been physically forced to have sexual intercourse when they did not want to.  The research actually breaks out rates for each grade showing how victimization rates increase each year pointing to a need to provide prevention activities earlier.</p>

<p>How does this data inform how we will do our prevention work?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This month the <a href="http://jiv.sagepub.com/content/current" class="broken_link">Journal of Interpersonal Violence</a> published <a href="http://jiv.sagepub.com/content/early/2012/01/27/0886260512436385.abstract" class="broken_link">&#8220;Predicting Perceptions of Date Rape: An Examination of Perpetrator Motivation, Relationship Length, and Gender Role Beliefs&#8221;</a>, a study conducted by David Angelone, PhD, Damon Mitchell PhD, and Lauren Lucente, BA. As many of us who work in the field of sexual violence prevention and intervention know, rape victims are often scrutinized by their peers, families, friends, and the criminal justice system. This study carefully examined how knowledge of the perpetrator&#8217;s motivation and the previous relationship between the victim and the perpetrator would influence the way that male and female college student&#8217;s viewed both the victim and the perpetrator. <strong>The current study &#8220;suggests that knowledge of the offender motivation legitimized the victim as the aggrieved party rather than excusing the perpetrator&#8217;s behavior&#8221;. </strong></p>
<p><img title="More..." src="http://calcasa.org/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif" alt="" /><span id="more-16851"></span></p>
<p>The study looked at both situational and observational variables. Situational variables refer to the personal characteristics of the victim and perpetrator and the environmental context in which the sexual assault occurred. The authors state, &#8220;In general, the closer the relationship between the victim and the perpetrator (e.g., marital vs. acquaintance vs. stranger) the more likely observers are to perceived the assault as consensual and the less likely they are to view the incident as a serious concern (Monson, Byrd, &amp; Langhinrichesen-Rohling, 1996).&#8221; Observer variables are personal characteristics of the study participants, such as gender and gender role attitudes.</p>

<p><a href="http://jiv.sagepub.com/content/early/2012/01/27/0886260512436385.abstract" class="broken_link">Abstract: </a>The purpose of the current study is to examine the influence of multiple offender motivations (including no indication of a motivation), relationship length, and gender role beliefs on perceptions of a male-on-female date rape. A sample of 348 U.S. college students read a brief vignette depicting a date rape and completed a questionnaire regarding their attributions about the victim (culpability, credibility, trauma, pleasure) and perpetrator (culpability, guilt, sentencing recommendations). Results indicate that providing observers with information about the perpetrator’s motivation was associated with lower victim blame. Relationship length is not predictive of rape attributions. Egalitarian gender role attitudes are associated with lower levels of victim blame. Overall, gender role attitudes exert a more significant influence on rape attributions than participant gender. The findings suggest that knowledge of an offender’s motivation as well as observers’ gender role attitudes can influence attributions about the culpability of victims and perpetrators of date rape.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[After the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released the National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey (NISVS) last&#160;&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/ViolencePrevention/">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> (CDC) released the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/nisvs/index.html" class="broken_link">National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey</a> (NISVS) last December, there was discussion on the <a href="http://www.preventconnect.org">PreventConnect</a> email group about the use of the term &#8220;sexual coercion&#8221; in NISVS.  PreventConnect forwarded these questions and concerns to the CDC.</p>
<p>I am pleased to be able to share the response from the CDC below.  For more information about NISVS, check out the archives of the <a href="http://www.preventconnect.org/2012/01/web-conference-findings-nisvs/">PreventConnect web conference about NISVS Findings</a>  (which includes more links and recordings of the sessions.)</p>
<p>Here is the full CDC response:</p>
<blockquote><p>We have seen the listserv posts with questions regarding the use of sexual coercion language in the NISVS measure, and we wanted to share some background information in hopes that it helps bring more understanding to the report.</p></blockquote>
<div>
<div lang="EN-US">
<div>
<blockquote><p>Our intent was not to replace the term “sexual violence” or “rape” with “sexual coercion.”  We consider “sexual violence” to be the overarching term. For the purposes of this survey we defined sexual violence as including the following categories: rape, being made to penetrate someone else, sexual coercion, unwanted sexual contact, and non-contact unwanted sexual experiences.</p>
<p>The use of the term, “sexual coercion” in sexual violence research has a fairly long history. We recognize that there has not been consistency in the way sexual coercion has been measured (i.e., some have used sexual coercion as an umbrella term so some sexual coercion measures include forcible and non-forcible sexually aggressive acts). However, sexual coercion was defined back in the mid-1980’s, similarly to how NISVS has defined it, in the work of Mary Koss and colleagues (Koss, Leonard, Beezely, &amp; Oros, 1985) and later by DeKeseredy and Kelly (1993), just as two examples. Koss and colleagues examined sexual coercion in the 1985 article as part of a continuum and defined it as “obtained sexual intercourse with a resistant woman through the use of extreme verbal pressure (i.e., false promises, insistent arguments, and threats to end the relationship). Similarly, DeKeseredy and Kelly treated sexual coercion as distinct from rape, as part of a continuum of unwanted sexual experiences.al</p>
<p>In developing the sexual violence measure for NISVS, we consulted commonly used measures of different forms of sexual violence such as the most recent version of the Sexual Experiences Survey (Koss et al, 2007). Much thought and previous research went into their selection of items to represent sexual coercion. In the article, the authors explicitly state that “restricting items only to those incidents that are crimes would ignore findings of the high frequency and emotionally distressing impact of noncriminalized sexual coercion (p. 359).”</p>
<p>In NISVS, sexual coercion is defined as “unwanted sexual penetration that occurs after a person is pressured in a nonphysical way. Sexual coercion refers to unwanted vaginal, oral, or anal sex after being pressured.” More specifically, the NISVS survey measured sexual coercion as having experienced any of the following:  being worn down by someone who repeatedly asked for sex or showed they were unhappy; feeling pressured by being lied to, being told promises that were untrue, having someone threaten to end a relationship or spread rumors; and sexual pressure due to someone using their influence or authority.</p>
<p>We included sexual coercion in the survey and subsequent report because we believe it is important to collect prevalence data on the range of sexual violence that women and men experience to present the true picture and impact of sexual violence.  Although most forms of sexual violence could be viewed as coercive and reflect a broad range of tactics, we believe it is important to measure both rape and other forms of sexual violence. Research indicates that sexual coercion (as defined in NISVS and by Koss and others) is emotionally distressing for those who experience it.  Our hope is that the inclusion of sexual coercion in addition to rape and other sexual violence in NISVS will help increase awareness of the seriousness of these forms of violence.</p>
<p>In the posts, there was some expressed concern regarding possible inconsistencies between the NISVS definitions and the FBI’s revised definition of rape.  We recognize and can appreciate the challenges inherent in educating the public about sexual violence.  We hear your concern about conflicting and/or overlapping definitions and how that can lead to confusion in the field and for your work.   According to the FBI website (Federal Bureau of Investigation, 2011), the revised definition is:  “Penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim.”  Just as the revised FBI definition of rape is more inclusive of different forms of rape, NISVS collects information about rape as well as other forms of sexual violence.</p>
<p>We appreciate and thank you for sharing your opinions and concerns about the NISVS report. We are dedicated to making NISVS a useful resource for the field.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here is a response to a recent Washington Post opinion column about rape statistics from the <a href="http://calcasa.org/prevention/response-cdc-overstating-sexual-violence/">California Coalition Against Sexual Assault</a>:</p>
<p>The recently released findings from the Center for Disease Control &amp; Prevention&#8217;s (CDC) <a href="http://calcasa.org/nisvs/" target="_blank">National Intimate Partner &amp; Sexual Violence Survey</a> (NISVS) recognized that almost 1 in 5 American woman have been raped in their lifetime. This is a wake up call to recognize how sexual violence is widespread. However, last week, in a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/cdc-study-on-sexual-violence-in-the-us-overstates-the-problem/2012/01/25/gIQAHRKPWQ_story.html" target="_blank"><em>Washington Post</em></a> opinion column, Christina Hoff Sommers claims this report is comprised of &#8220;inflated statistics and sensationalism.&#8221;<span id="more-16814"></span></p>
<p>Sommers, a resident scholar at the <a href="http://www.aei.org/" target="_blank">American Enterprise Institute</a>, has a long history of criticizing information about violence against women in her articles and books such as &#8220;Who Stole Feminism<em>?&#8221;</em> In the <em>Washington Post</em> article, she argues the validity of the CDC&#8217;s research in comparison to the number rapes reported to the F.B.I. (which used a definition that <a href="http://calcasa.org/publicaffairs/fbi-rape-definition/" target="_blank">recently changed</a> because it was too restrictive) and those reported on the Bureau of Justice Statistics’ National Crime Victimization Survey. Sommers writes,</p>
<blockquote><p>The [CDC&#8217;s] figures are wildly at odds with official crime statistics. The FBI found that 84,767 rapes were reported to law enforcement authorities in 2010. The Bureau of Justice Statistics’ National Crime Victimization Survey, the gold standard in crime research, reports 188,380 rapes and sexual assaults on females and males in 2010. Granted, not all assaults are reported to authorities. But where did the CDC find 13.7 million victims of sexual crimes that the professional criminologists had overlooked?</p></blockquote>
<p>The CDC survey finds so many more victims than the criminal justice-based statistics because it asks about people’s actual experiences. It is a strength of this survey that it asks behavior-specific questions and includes many types of unwanted sexual violence experiences, in addition to rape. The FBI — until this month — only recorded statistics of vaginal rape that are voluntarily reported by the police departments. The National Crime Victimization Survey asks only about rape as part of series of questions regarding various crimes. The CDC has developed a survey that recognizes sexual violence is not only a crime, but it is also a public health problem.</p>
<p>At the same time as these crimes are continuing to occur, funding is in jeopardy for rape crisis centers across the nation. There are already more survivors than social service agencies have the ability to serve. In order to provide services to more survivors — and also to do the primary prevention work to stop violence before it occurs — the rape crisis centers need to increase funding.</p>
<p>Whether your rape statistic is 84,767 or 188,380, sexual violence is still happening, which should make this a priority issue for rape crisis centers, media, funders and other social service agencies. This survey suggests that the problem is even bigger and requires more attention.</p>
<p>Instead using energy that minimizes the prevalence of sexual violence, let’s put our energy toward creating more programs to prevent sexual violence and opportunities to support survivors in their healing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently published in the Journal of Urban Health: Bulletin of the New York Academy of Medicine, “<a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/n7u339g1w1462h02/" class="broken_link">Exposure to Partner, Family, and Community Violence: Gang-Affiliated Latina Women and Risk of Unintended Pregnancy</a>”<a href="http://lib.bioinfo.pl/pmid:22160445" class="broken_link"> </a>examines the relationship “between gang involvement and reproductive health, and the pathways through which childhood, family, and relationship violence exposure may lead to unintended pregnancy”.</p>
<p>The authors studied 20 young females with known gang histories of gang-involvement, recruited through a gang-intervention program in Los Angeles, CA. The article provides detailed interview transcriptions that provide insight into the 20 young women’s exposure to violence, pregnancy experiences, access to knowledge about reproductive health, male partner pregnancy intentions and sexual coercion, male partner physical and sexual violence, exposure to interparental violence and child abuse, as well as gangs and sexual violence.</p>
<p><img title="More..." src="http://calcasa.org/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif" alt="" /><span id="more-16784"></span></p>
<p>The authors suggest:</p>
<p>“…these stories offer some implications for practice and policy. These findings may guide targeted pregnancy prevention efforts among this highly vulnerable and hard-to-reach population of urban gang-affiliated Latinas as well as encourage the integration of sexual violence prevention and reproductive health promotion within gang violence intervention programs. The clustering of partner, family, and community violence with young women’s pregnancy suggests that programs that explicitly address the connections between violence exposure and pregnancy prevention are needed. Universal pregnancy prevention is unlikely to address the unique challenges facing youth in urban settings with high rates of gang violence” (Miller et al. 2011)</p>

<p>While teen pregnancy rates appear to be declining in the USA overall, the rate of decline among young Latinas has been less than other ethnic groups. Among the myriad factors associated with elevated pregnancy rates, for Latina girls living in the inner city, exposure to gang and community violence may be a critical context for increased pregnancy risk. This study explores the relationship between gang involvement and reproductive health, and the pathways through which childhood, family, and relationship violence exposure may lead to unintended pregnancy. Interviews of 20 young adult Latinas with known gang involvement in Los Angeles County were audiotaped, transcribed, and coded for key themes related to violence exposure and reproductive health. Limited access to reproductive health care compounded by male partner sexual and pregnancy coercion, as well as physical and sexual violence, emerged in the interviews. Exposures to interparental domestic violence, childhood physical and sexual abuse, and gang violence were prominent and closely associated with unhealthy and abusive intimate relationships. Adverse childhood experiences and exposure to partner, family, and community violence impact the reproductive lives and choices of young Latina women in gangs. These findings may guide targeted pregnancy prevention efforts among urban gang-affiliated Latinas as well as encourage the integration of sexual violence prevention and reproductive health promotion within gang violence intervention programs.</p>

<p><strong>Katherine Beavis</strong> &amp; <strong>Emily Haas</strong> of the <a href="http://www.purdue.edu/incsapp/" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Indiana Campus Sexual Assault Primary Prevention Project</a> describe the way in which the development of communication makes a difference in the prevention of sexual violence.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since the 1960′s and 1970′s, the U.S. experienced a shift in societal perception that had denied, dismissed and ignored gender-based violence to the acknowledgment of sexual violence as a major social problem.  &#8220;<a href="http://www.vawnet.org/Assoc_Files_VAWnet/AR_ChangingPerceptions.pdf" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Changing Perceptions of Sexual Violence Over Time</a>” maintains that understanding perceptions is helpful because it offers a “roadmap of future directions” to further engage communities in the discourse surrounding sexual violence.</p>
<p>On November 9, 2011, join other <a href="http://www.preventconnect.org/" target="_blank">PreventConnect</a> prevention practitioners throughout the country in the November PreventConnect Reading Club to examine “<a href="http://www.vawnet.org/Assoc_Files_VAWnet/AR_ChangingPerceptions.pdf" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Changing Perceptions of Sexual Violence Over Time</a>” by Sarah McMahon in consultation with Karen Baker, published by <a href="http://www.vawnet.org/" target="_blank">VAWnet</a>, a project of the National Resource Center on Domestic Violence.</p>
<p>The Prevent Connect Reading Club is a small, one hour session where public health practitioners and researchers can discuss the intersections of research and practice in ending sexual violence.</p>
<p>NOTE: <em>This is not a web conference nor a training.  Your active participation is essential to the Reading Club.</em></p>
<p><strong>READING CLUB SESSION</strong></p>
<p>Wednesday, November 9, 2011</p>
<p>This sixty minute (60 min) session will start at 11.00 a.m. Pacific Standard Time (2 p.m. Eastern Standard Time).  Registration is limited to 50 people per session.</p>
<p>NOTE: The November 2011 session is full!  To add your name to the wait list, <a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/2738TLX" target="_blank">click here</a>.</p>

<p>While the focus of this report is on research, I like the way this report acknowledges that research is only one type of evidence used for violence prevention work. The report states</p>
<blockquote><p>Literature suggest that two other forms of evidence are also very important when making decisions based on evidence:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Experiential Evidence</strong>: This type of evidence is based on th professional insight, understanding, skill, and expertise that is accumulated over time and is often referred to as intuitive or tacit knowledge.</li>
<li><strong>Contextual Evidence</strong>: This type of evidence is based on factors that address whether a strategy is useful, feasible to implement, and accepted by a particular community.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out all of the great charts on effectiveness and strength of evidence.</p>
<p>Click <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pub/UnderstandingEvidence_prt1.html" class="broken_link">here</a> to get this report.</p>
<p>Do you find this report helpful for how you will approach violence prevention evidence?</p>

<p>In this PreventConnect web conference, <a href="http://www.preventconnect.org/display/displayTextItems.cfm?itemID=330&amp;sectionID=248" class="broken_link">Understanding the differences between National Sexual Violence and Intimate Partner Violence Surveys</a>, we explored the differences between public health and criminal justice surveys when looking at sexual violence and intimate partner violence. Michele Lynberg Black and David Lee shared a conversation about different types of data and its usefulness to prevention practitioners.</p>
<p>In October 2011, the <a href="http://e2ma.net/go/7052850504/208549713/221865215/1408187/goto:http://www.cdc.gov" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> (CDC) will release results of <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/NISVS/index.html" class="broken_link">National Intimate Partner Sexual Violence Survey</a> (NISVS). The new information about intimate partner violence, sexual violence and a stalking will draw additional attention to these issues and create new opportunities to advance prevention activities. <span id="more-15523"></span></p>
<p>The information discussed in the web conference provided practitioners with the knowledge necessary to be able to speak about the differences in SV/IPV national surveys and which are best for your data needs. Future PreventConnect web conferences will provide additional information about framing messages based on data, how to interpret data and review the results of NISVS (after the release in October 2011).</p>
<p><strong>Host:</strong> David Lee, <a href="http://e2ma.net/go/7052850504/208549713/221865217/1408187/goto:http://www.preventconnect.org/" target="_blank" class="broken_link">PreventConnect</a>, <a href="http://e2ma.net/go/7052850504/208549713/221865218/1408187/goto:http://calcasa.org/" target="_blank" class="broken_link">California Coalition Against Sexual Assault</a></p>
<p><strong>Presenter: </strong>Michele Lynberg Black, Ph.D., M.P.H., Lead Epidemiologist responsible for NISVS, <em> <a href="http://e2ma.net/go/7052850504/208549713/221865219/1408187/goto:http://www.cdc.gov" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a></em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://naesv.org/">National Alliance to End Sexual Violence</a> has released a fact sheet titled <a href="http://www.nsvrc.org/sites/default/files/CostsConsequencesSV.pdf">Costs and Consequences of Sexual Violence and Cost-Effective Solutions</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>The  best available research tells us that crime victimization costs the  United States $450 billion annually. Rape is the most costly of all  crimes to its victims, with total estimated costs at $127 billion a year  (excluding the cost of child sexual abuse). In 2008, researchers  estimated that each rape cost approximately $151,423. Sexual abuse has a  negative impact on children’s educational attainment, later job  performance, and earnings. Sexual violence survivors experience reduced  income in adulthood as a result of victimization in adolescence, with a  lifetime income loss estimated at $241,600. Sexual abuse interferes with  women’s ability to work. Fifty percent of sexual violence  victims had to quit or were forced to leave their jobs in the year  following their assaults due to the severity of their reactions. In  2008, violence and abuse constituted up to 37.5% of total health care  costs, or up to $750 billion.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Pregnancy Coercion, Intimate Partner Violence and Unintended Pregnancy. </strong></p>
<p>Miller E, Decker M.R, McCauley H.L, Tancredi D.J, Levenson R.R, Waldman J, Schoenwald P, Silverman J.G.<strong> Contraception </strong>Volume 81, Issue 4, 316–322, April 2010.

<p><strong>Abstract </strong></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Background</strong>: Reproductive control including pregnancy coercion (coercion by male partners to become pregnant) and birth control sabotage (partner interference with contraception) may be associated with partner violence and risk for unintended pregnancy among young adult females utilizing family planning clinic services.</p>
<p><strong>Study Design:</strong> A cross-sectional survey was administered to females ages 16–29 years seeking care in five family planning clinics in Northern California (<em>N</em>=1278).</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong>: Fifty-three percent of respondents reported physical or sexual partner violence, 19% reported experiencing pregnancy coercion and 15% reported birth control sabotage. One third of respondents reporting partner violence (35%) also reported reproductive control. Both pregnancy coercion and birth control sabotage were associated with unintended pregnancy (AOR 1.83, 95% CI 1.36–2.46, and AOR 1.58, 95% CI 1.14–2.20, respectively). In analyses stratified by partner violence exposure, associations of reproductive control with unintended pregnancy persisted only among women with a history of partner violence.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusions</strong>: Pregnancy coercion and birth control sabotage are common among young women utilizing family planning clinics, and in the context of partner violence, are associated with increased risk for unintended pregnancy.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://calcasa.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/3813256968_8f1260be76.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-14740" title="223/365: Tape measure" src="http://calcasa.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/3813256968_8f1260be76-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a>This week I am attending the California Coalition Against Sexual Assault’s <a href="http://calcasa.org/calcasa/measuring-sexual-violence-prevention-efforts-training-series/">series of trainings on Measuring Prevention</a> where California’s rape crisis centers and domestic violence programs are exploring how to evaluate their prevention programs and examine ways to collect and analyze data. Given the small budgets to implement and evaluate the programs, we are exploring creative ways to do this.</p>
<p>The article <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0886260510393010" class="broken_link">Commentary on Foubert, Godin, &amp; Tatum (2010): The Evolution of Sexual Violence Prevention and the Urgency for Effectiveness</a> recently ePublished for the <em>Journal of Interpersonal Violence</em> prompted me to think hard about how we measure sexual violence prevention efforts.<span id="more-14738"></span></p>
<p>Since sexual violence recognized as a serious problem, there is a growing consensus that both intervention and prevention are necessary. But creating change that will actually reduce the rates of sexual violence is quite complex. There are no easy answers, no magic solution nor one key behavior that will absolutely lead to prevention, Even with a complex issue such as HIV prevention, we know that regular consistent use of condoms will reduce incidence of HIV infection. But there is no simple equivalent behavior for rape prevention. (Part of me wants to say there is – just don’t force someone to have sex. While this sentiment is understandable and true, unfortunately this message alone is not really a good strategy to actually ending rape.)</p>
<p>Evaluation is a tool that will assist us in determining how we can prevent rape. I think of the process of developing, implementing and evaluating prevention efforts as a combination of art and science. Science provides essential tools to for our work (such as epidemiology to understand the problem, and rigorous evaluation of prevention program effectiveness), but the art is the creativity and innovation that goes beyond what we have done in the past to create new approaches. While science is grounded in testable knowledge, I do not want to lose the art of finding ways to connect with communities and fostering change to shift cultural norms.  Some of the greatest movements in our history to create change relied heavily on the art more than the science to foster change. The civil rights movement did not rely of randomized clinical trials to take action to change policies.  I want to learn from both the art and science of prevention.</p>
<p><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0886260510393010" class="broken_link">Commentary on Foubert, Godin, &amp; Tatum (2010): The Evolution of Sexual Violence Prevention and the Urgency for Effectiveness</a> looks at the science of evaluation of sexual violence prevention. The authors describe “experimental and rigorous quasi-experimental designs with well-matched control groups that have been replicated by investigators other than the developers as the designs that provide the strongest evidence.” What I found especially useful in this article is the notion that evaluation is part of a process.  The authors suggest that “[r]efining a program through less rigorous evaluation methods is often cost effective and may result in a more cohesive and well-developed program that can then be subjected to more rigorous evaluation.” That process is what I described above as the art.</p>
<p>In this article, the authors critique the published evaluations of John Foubert and his colleagues about <a href="http://www.oneinfourusa.org/themensprogram.php">The Men’s Program</a>.  I too have written previously about some of <a href="http://calcasa.org/prevention/considering-research-results-from-a-rape-prevention-program/">my concerns about this program</a>.  I agree that the one-hour presentation of the Men’s Program is inconsistent with generally accepted prevention principles.  I find it hard to image actual behavior change comes from such a short presentation alone.</p>
<p>However, I do like the methodology of interviewing participants seven months after the presentation as <a href="http://okstate.academia.edu/JohnFoubert/Papers/407358/Foubert_J._D._Tatum_J._and_Godin_E._2010_._First-year_male_students_perceptions_of_a_rape_prevention_program_seven_months_after_their_participation_Attitude_and_behavior_changes._Journal_of_College_Student_Development_51_707-715" class="broken_link">Fobert, Godin and Tautm had done in their evaluation</a>. That is a good early effort for prevention to inform the development and determine whether the practice has promise.  The authors of the commentary suggest that over time the rigor of evaluation should increase.</p>
<p>What does this mean for the prevention practitioner? At this time there is so little research on sexual violence prevention programs that demonstrate effectiveness at reducing rape rates. As we read the research that is released, I agree we need to look at the rigor of the evaluation method.  Unfortunately the cost and time commitment for quality effectiveness research is high.  In our prevention efforts we must use systematic evaluation efforts such as process evaluation and measures of potential indicators of change to inform the program’s development and implementation – that is the art of creating and conducting a prevention program.</p>
<p>However, that is not enough. Over time we will need to conduct more rigorous research to determine the impact of our work – find a way to use science as tool to understand what our prevention efforts can do. In the meantime, we must continue to innovate – that is engage in the practice of art to create new approaches to creating change.</p>
<p>How are you using both art and science to improve your prevention efforts?</p>
<p>Here is the full abstract and references to the article:</p>
<p><strong>Commentary on Foubert, Godin, &amp; Tatum (2010): The Evolution of</strong> <strong>Sexual Violence Prevention and the Urgency for Effectiveness</strong></p>
<p>Andra L. Teten Tharp, Sarah DeGue, Karen Lang, Linda Anne Valle, Greta Massetti, Melissa Holt and Jennifer Matjasko<em>, Journal of Interpersonal Violence</em>, 2011, ePublished February 28, 2011</p>
<p>Click <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0886260510393010" class="broken_link">here</a> for a link to the abstract on the journal’s web site.</p>
<blockquote><p>Foubert, Godin, and Tatum describe qualitative effects among college men  of The Men’s Program, a one-session sexual violence                      prevention program. This article and the program it  describes are representative of many sexual violence prevention  programs                      that are in practice and provide an opportunity for  a brief discussion of the development and evaluation of sexual violence                      prevention approaches. In this commentary, we will  focus on two considerations for an evolving field: the adherence to the                      principles of prevention and the use of rigorous  evaluation methods to demonstrate effectiveness. We argue that the  problem                      of sexual violence has created urgency for  effective prevention programs and that scientific and prevention  standards provide                      the best foundation to meet this need.</p></blockquote>

<p>The <a href="http://www.nrcdv.org/">National Resource Center on Domestic Violence</a> has released its&#8217; newly redesigned <a href="http://www,vawnet.org" class="broken_link">VAWnet website</a>. VAWnet is a comprehensive and easily accessible online collection of full-text, searchable materials and resources on domestic violence, sexual violence and related issues. With this redesign, it is even easier to find materials and resources.  Whenever I am asked a question, I frequently first turn to VAWnet to find useful materials.</p>
<p>For example, in their sexual violence prevention section VAWnet has <a href="http://www.vawnet.org/sexual-violence/prevention.php?type=web_desc_SC" class="broken_link">3 special collections</a>, <a href="http://www.vawnet.org/sexual-violence/prevention.php?type=web_desc_AR" class="broken_link">7 applied research papers</a>, and 4<a href="http://www.vawnet.org/sexual-violence/prevention.php?type=web_desc_TT" class="broken_link">0 training tools among</a> its 184 items.</p>
<p>As a national online resource center, VAWnet collaborates with CALCASA&#8217;s <a href="http://www.preventconnect.org">PreventConnect</a> and the <a href="http://www.nsvrc.org">National Sexual Violence Resource Center</a>. While PreventConnect provides the place for the  online conversation about prevention, VAWnet has an great online collection of materials and resources.</p>

<p>In this world of online media, social networking and blogs, teen magazines are still have a large presence (for example <em>Seventeen</em>’s circulation is still over 2 million). In the article <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1077801210387332" class="broken_link">Teen Magazines as Educational Texts on Dating Violence: The $2.99 Approach</a> published in the journal <em>Violence Against Women</em>, authors Kettrey and Emery analyzed how teen magazines reported on dating violence, rape and domestic violence.<span id="more-13385"></span></p>
<p>I am not surprised that the study’s content analysis found almost 95% of the articles used an individual frame focusing on individual behavior while only 65% of the articles recognized social factors (described as “societal attitudes, sexism, socialization, violence in the media, societal tolerance of violence, and poverty.”)</p>
<p>For dating violence and sexual violence prevention efforts, this study suggests that prevention not only provides information, but it also must help reframe dating violence as a social and cultural phenomenon. Kettrey and Emery recognize that these articles are often a resource teens use to find out about dating violence and suggest</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;it is essential that educators, counselors, coaches, and other professionals who work with adolescents understand this and be prepared to deal with the content of those articles so that they can help adolescents construct more accurate meanings around the physical and sexual violence they may encounter in their dating relationships.</p></blockquote>
<p>What we also need is media to frame the issues of dating violence and sexual violence from a social and cultural perspective. What examples have you seen that do this well?</p>

<p>Abstract:</p>
<p>This study analyzed the portrayal of dating violence in teen magazines published in the United States. Such an investigation is important because previous research indicates that dating violence is a serious problem facing adolescents, teen magazines overemphasize the importance of romantic relationships, and teens who read this genre frequently or for education/advice are especially susceptible to its messages. Results indicated that although teen magazines do frame dating violence as a cultural problem, they are much more likely to utilize an individual frame that emphasizes the victim. Results were discussed as they apply to the responsibilities of professionals working with adolescents.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The traditional prevention program paradigm treats its audience as the object of the intervention. For example, professionals provide a curriculum to help youth avoid sexual violence and dating violence. However, a transformative prevention program supports youth to become &#8220;agents of change&#8221;; they are not the “targets&#8221; of the intervention but they are the part of the solutiom&#8221; to the problem.</p>
<p>Prevention efforts like <a href="http://www.mencanstoprape.org/info-url2696/info-url_list.htm?section=Men%20of%20Strength%20%28MOST%29%20Clubs" class="broken_link">Men of Strength Clubs</a>, <a href="http://www.startstrongteens.org/">Start Strong programs</a> and <a href="http://www.peersolutions.org/intro.html" class="broken_link">STAND &amp; SERVE</a> are just a few examples of prevention programs that adopt this approach. <span id="more-13319"></span>I was pleased to see the recent article, <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1524839909357316" class="broken_link">Youth Empowerment Solutions for Peaceful Communities: Combining Theory and Practice in a Community-Level Violence Prevention Curriculum</a> that highlights an afterschool program curriculum that engages youth to take action to prevent violence.</p>
<p>The article highlights a youth curriculum that focused on community change. I find the change model to be instructive (see below): it works with youth, community and adults’ capacity to work with youth.</p>

<p>This article describes the development and evaluation of an after-school curriculum designed to prepare adolescents to prevent violence through community change. This curriculum, part of the Youth Empowerment Solutions for Peaceful Communities (YES) program, is guided by empowerment and ecological theories within a positive youth development context. YES is designed to enhance the capacity of adolescents and adults to work together to plan and implement community change projects. The youth curriculum is organized around six themed units: (a) Youth as Leaders, (b) Learning about Our Community, (c) Improving Our Community, (d) Building Intergenerational Partnerships, (e) Planning for Change, and (f) Action and Reflection. The curriculum was developed through an iterative process. Initially, program staff members documented their activities with youth. These outlines were formalized as curriculum sessions. Each session was reviewed by the program and research staff and revised based on underlying theory and practical application. The curriculum process evaluation includes staff and youth feedback. This theoretically based, field-tested curriculum is designed to be easily adapted and implemented in a diverse range of communities.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/archpediatrics.2010.229">study</a> published in the December 2010 issue of <em>Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine</em>, the researchers found that high school students who reported perpetrating dating violence also were violent toward peers and siblings. For prevention practitioners, such findings requires us to consider how we can <a href="../../../../../prevention/break-down-the-silos/">break down the silos</a> between related issues in our prevention work.</p>
<p>18,7% of students reported perpetrating partner violence in the last month.  This study found that girls reported perpetrating partner violence than boys. <span id="more-13048"></span>The authors gave five reason to explain what they said was “consistent with at least 16 previous studies”:</p>
<blockquote><p>First, it has been suggested that assessments of DV that do not solicit information about sexual violence may yield underestimates of perpetration by boys. Second, assessments that do not take into account the severity of the assault or injuries mischaracterize perpetration by obscuring sex-based severity differences. However, 2 studies have found nearly equivalent rates of injury reported by male and female victims of DV, and at least 3 studies have found that a greater proportion of girls than boys report perpetrating “severe” DV. Third, boys may be more likely to be dishonest about their DV perpetration on surveys, and girls may be more likely to overestimate their perpetration (eg, report playful hitting as abuse), although research suggests that adult men and women alike tend to underreport their own partner violence perpetration. This issue has yet to be investigated among adolescents. Fourth, female reports of violence against dating partners may reflect self-defensive actions, whereas male reports may not. Finally, girls in our sample may have reported their DV perpetration accurately. Because this study was not designed to explore the full situational context or consequences of DV perpetration, we were unable to determine why we found a higher perpetration rate among girls than boys.</p></blockquote>
<p>The study used the <a href="http://pubpages.unh.edu/%7Emas2/CTS15.pdf" class="broken_link">Revised Conflict Tactics Scale</a> to measure the violence. (See a <a href="http://new.vawnet.org/category/Main_Doc.php?docid=388" class="broken_link">critique of conflict tactics scale</a> from <a href="http://www.vawnet.org/">VAWnet</a>).</p>

<p>ABSTRACT:</p>
<p><em>Objectives </em> To assess the co-occurrence of past-month physical assault of a dating partner and violence against peers and siblings among a locally representative sample of high school students and to explore correlates of dating violence (DV) perpetration.<br />
Design  Cross-sectional survey design.</p>
<p><em>Setting </em> Twenty-two public high schools in Boston, Massachusetts.</p>
<p><em>Participants </em> A sample of urban high school students (n = 1398) who participated in the Boston Youth Survey, implemented January through April of 2008.</p>
<p><em>Main Outcomes Measures </em> Self-reported physical DV in the month before the survey, defined as pushing, shoving, slapping, hitting, punching, kicking, or choking a dating partner 1 or more times.</p>
<p><em>Results </em> Among the respondents, 18.7%, 41.2%, and 31.2% of students reported past-month perpetration of physical DV, peer violence, and sibling violence, respectively. Among violence perpetrators, the perpetration of DV only was rare (7.9%). Controlling for age and school, the association between sibling violence and DV was strong for boys (adjusted prevalence ratio, 3.81; 95% confidence interval, 2.07-6.99) and for girls (1.83; 1.44-2.31), and the association between peer violence and DV perpetration was strong for boys (5.13; 3.15-8.35) and for girls (2.57; 1.87-3.52). Dating violence perpetration was also associated with substance use, knife carrying, delinquency, and exposure to community violence.</p>
<p><em>Conclusions </em> Adolescents who perpetrated physical DV were also likely to have perpetrated peer and/or sibling violence. Dating violence is likely one of many co-occurring adolescent problem behaviors, including sibling and peer violence perpetration, substance use, weapon carrying, and academic problems.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>&#8220;That’s somebody’s daughter. That’s somebody’s sister. Do you want somebody treating your sister like that? No? Well, then, keep that in mind.”</p></blockquote>
<p>This reminder from a father to his son is quoted in a <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0886260510383028" class="broken_link">new study</a> published online in the <em>Journal of Interpersonal Violence</em> about how African American families discuss teen dating violence.</p>
<p>While many teen dating violence prevention program emphasize school based curricula, youth leadership and media messaging, families remain an important piece of prevention efforts. I see the social ecological model (below) as a model of different types of activities that should be in a comprehensive prevention effort.  We cannot limit our prevention efforts to individual education or community education campaigns.</p>
<p>This article provides an interesting qualitative study of how parents address dating violence and promote healthy relationships.  Many parents are protective of their daughters, some parents speak from their experiences of being abused, and other parents promote self esteem as a protective factor to reduce the possibility of dating violence.</p>
<p>How does your prevention efforts support parents to prevent dating violence?</p>
<p>Below is the abstract and link to the article on the journal’s web site.</p>

<p>The article discusses a study conducted between December 2007 and March 2008 that involved 19 gender-stratified focus groups with African American parents and adolescents from Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, to explore the process and content of parent-adolescent communication about sex. Discussions about intimate partner violence (IPV) and healthy relationships emerge inductively as critical topics in these conversations. The authors use a grounded theory approach to content analysis to identify and organize themes related to discussions on these topics. A total of 125 participants from 52 families are recruited for the study. Family history of child sexual abuse often motivates discussions. Mothers are described as the primary parent discussing sexual issues with children. Fathers primarily role model ideal male partnership behavior for sons and daughters. Parents seek to prevent daughters from experiencing sexual abuse or emotional manipulation by partners and focus on instilling a sense of responsibility to and respect for romantic partners in sons. Parents prioritize and express the need for tools to influence their adolescent&#8217;s socialization as romantic partners. Mothers and fathers approach this process differently. Family-focused interventions to prevent unhealthy relationships can build on parent&#8217;s efforts.</p>

<p>In my work to prevent sexual and domestic violence, I see links to many other related topics such as child maltreatment, sexual harassment and bullying, Yet, often there are different people engaged in each of these types of work, different funders, discrete groups of researchers and separate conferences to address these issues. We are trapped in out silos.</p>
<p>I agree with my colleagues at the <a href="http://www.preventioninstitute.org/">Prevention Institute</a> who say that “a good solution often solves multiple problems.”  In the <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/jwh.2010.2311">recent issue of <em>Journal of Women’s Health</em></a>, <span id="more-12563"></span>Vivolo and her colleagues at the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> call for linking different issues to build effective sexual violence prevention efforts.</p>
<p>In the article <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/jwh.2010.2311">Developing Sexual Violence Prevention Strategies by Bridging Spheres of Public Health</a>, the authors examine risk factors that are common with perpetration of sexual violence and other issues. For example they stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>Early initiation of sexual intercourse is an example of a developmental experience that is a risk factor for both SV perpetration and negative sexual health outcomes, such as unintended pregnancy and HIV/STD transmission.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, risk factors are not necessarily the same as causes of a problem.  I would not want to suggest that early initiation of sexual intercourse is a cause of sexual violence perpetration. Nonetheless, we can consider the links with other health issues.</p>
<p>I appreciate their call to break down the silos and coordinate prevention efforts:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;although the evidence base for SV prevention is still growing, the SV field stands to benefit from the knowledge of our neighbors in public health, spefically HIV/STD and teen pregnancy prevention. Current programs that are aimed at reducing sexual risk behaviors and increasing protective factors against HIV/STD and pregnancy in high school populations could be modified to include messages that simultaneously target SV perpetration. The core components of effective SV prevention programs could be integrated into effective prevention strategies from other health areas.</p></blockquote>
<p>Back to a good solution solving multiple problems. I want to go beyond looking at risk factors. If we focus on common protective factors we can link our efforts to build healthy lives and communities.</p>
<p>Below is the full abstract and link to the article on the journal’s web site:</p>

<p>Abstract Sexual violence (SV) is a significant public health problem with multiple negative physical and emotional sequelae for both victims and perpetrators. Despite substantial research and program activity over the past 20 years, there are few programs with demonstrated effectiveness in preventing SV. As a result, the field may benefit from considering effective approaches used with other risk behaviors that share risk factors with SV. The Division of Violence Prevention (DVP) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has taken several steps to identify and understand the breadth of risk factors for sexual violence and to delineate the implications of these factors in the development of effective prevention strategies. This report from CDC will highlight several risk factors that, although not traditionally included in SV prevention efforts, may be important areas on which to focus and may ultimately prevent youth from embarking on trajectories resulting in SV perpetration.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What creates the changes necessary to prevent sexual violence and dating violence?  While many of our educational programs focus on increasing knowledge about rape and violence, I am skeptical that increasing knowledge alone will create change.</p>
<p>The theory behind education is something like this: change people’s knowledge that will shift their attitudes; which will in turn shift their beliefs; and will then have an affect on their behavior. But this does not seem to be the best way to create change.<span id="more-12013"></span></p>
<p>Take healthy eating for an example. Most of use now that we should eat healthy; we have attitudes that eating healthy is good for us; we even believe that eating healthy is good for us. But do we actually eat healthily?  By trying to create change on an individual basis, we do not develop the best strategies for actual behavior change.</p>
<p>I think the more important influences are more community-level:  the social expectations, what is modeled behavior, what is reinforced by media messages what is considered to be socially desirable influence behavior more than knowledge,</p>
<p>Yet, I see a lot of research on individual risks for sexual abuse and dating violence. Where is the research on community factors?</p>
<p>So I was excited to read the new article published in the <em>American Journal of Public Health</em>, <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.2105/AJPH.2009.169730">Neighborhood Predictors of Dating Violence Victimization and Perpetration in Young Adulthood: A Multilevel Study</a>. In this paper, the authors examined neighborhood factors that are associated with dating violence. They considered “collective efficacy” – a concept capturing “community cohesiveness and residents’ willingness to intervene for the common good; “ Here is how they measured it:</p>
<blockquote><p>collective efficacy was a summary scale of social cohesion and informal social control. The social cohesion scale was a sum of 5 items assessing community residents’ willingness to help and trust each other and to get along and whether they shared the same values and perceived the community as close-knit. Informal social control assessed the likelihood of neighbors intervening if children were skipping school, hanging out on a street corner, or spray-painting graffiti.</p></blockquote>
<p>The findings of this study found different affects for collective efficacy on victimization and perpetration, as well as differences based on gender (see note below.) Also, the findings demonstrated differences based on the level of poverty. In conclusion, the researchers suggest that teen dating violence can be addressed with community-level comprehensive prevention efforts.<br />
As se are developing, implementing, evaluating and researching prevention efforts, let’s use concepts such as those explored in this study to develop community-level prevention that goes beyond individual knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: This study indicated that females perpetuate more dating violence than males. The measure of dating violence used were items selected from the Revised Conflict Tactics Scale. While this scale is commonly used in research, there are many concerns (see the <a href="http://new.vawnet.org/category/Main_Doc.php?docid=388" class="broken_link">VAWnet paper about concerns about the Conflict Tactics Scale</a>.) Recently Elizabeth Reed and colleagues wrote about problem of <a href="../../../../../prevention/losing-the-gender-in-gender-based-violence/">removing the gender from gender based violence</a>. While these concerns are important, I also think the exploration of neighborhood factors important for understanding how to prevent dating violence.</p>

<p><strong>Objectives</strong>. We examined whether social processes of neighborhoods, such as collective ef?cacy, during individual’s adolescent years affect the likelihood of being involved in physical dating violence during young adulthood.</p>
<p><strong>Methods</strong>. Using longitudinal data on 633 urban youths aged 13 to 19 years at baseline and data from their neighborhoods (collected by the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods), we ran multilevel linear regression models separately by gender to assess the association between collective ef?cacy and physical dating violence victimization and perpetration, controlling for individual covariates, neighborhood poverty, and perceived neighborhood violence.</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong>. Females were signi?cantly more likely than were males to be perpetrators of dating violence during young adulthood (38% vs 19%). Multilevel analyses revealed some variation in dating violence at the neighborhood level, partly accounted for by collective ef?cacy. Collective ef?cacy was predictive of victimization for males but not females after control for confounders; it was marginally associated with perpetration (P = .07). The effects of collective ef?cacy varied by neighborhood poverty. Finally, a signi?cant proportion (intraclass correlation = 14%–21%) of the neighborhood-level variation in male perpetration remained unexplained after modeling.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusions</strong>. Community-level strategies may be useful in preventing dating violence.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a man working in sexual violence and domestic violence movement, frequently I am asked “why do you do this work?” Why do people ask this question?  Is it because they ask everyone (female and male) why do this work? Or are they surprised that a man is engaged in this work?</p>
<p>Another reason is that they want to figure out how to bring more men to violence against women prevention work.  In the article <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1077801210376749" class="broken_link">&#8220;How Can I Not?&#8221;: Men&#8217;s Pathways to Involvement in Anti-Violence Against Women Work</a><strong> </strong>recently published in the journal <em>Violence Against Women</em>, authors Casey and Smith explore why men get involved in anti-violence against women work.<span id="more-10770"></span></p>
<p>This qualitative study used interviews with 27 men. While there are some significant limitations of this sample (for example all the men were white), the authors ask an interesting question.  The authors describe their findings as:</p>
<blockquote><p>First, all men but one had some sort of “sensitizing” or priming experience that raised their level of consciousness regarding issues of violence or gender inequity and seemed to lay the groundwork for being open to involvement when an opportunity arose. Second, all men had at least one tangible opportunity or entrée into an antiviolence group, volunteer opportunity, or job. Third, the meaning that participants had come to attach to the initial sensitizing and/or to the opportunity experience seemed to be a critical component of men’s decision to devote time to antiviolence work.</p></blockquote>
<p>From your experience, how do men get involved in this work? Myself, I like to point to how my  mother modeled getting involved as she volunteered in a battered women shelter in the 1970s. Her example demonstrated that everyone (including her sons) should do something to end violence against women .</p>
<p>PS. A small correction: the authors describe recruiting through the “Prevention Institute Sexual Violence Listserve” but I think they meant the <a href="http://www.preventconnect.org/display/displaySection.cfm?sectionID=240" class="broken_link">Prevention Connection Listserv</a> (since Prevention Institute does not have a sexual violence listerv and requests to participate in this study were posted in 2008.)  A lost chance to have Prevention Connection named in a peer reviewed journal.</p>

<blockquote><p>Despite growing male participation in ending violence against women, little is known about the factors that precipitate men&#8217;s engagement as antiviolence &#8220;allies.&#8221; This study presents findings from a qualitative analysis of interviews with 27 men who recently initiated involvement in an organization or event dedicated to ending sexual or domestic violence. Findings suggest that men&#8217;s engagement is a process that occurs over time, that happens largely through existing social networks, and that is influenced by exposure to sensitizing experiences, tangible involvement opportunities and specific types of meaning making related to violence. Implications for models of ally development and for efforts to engage men in antiviolence work are discussed.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was very excited when I read this in the article recently published in Family Community Health titled <a href="http://journals.lww.com/familyandcommunityhealth/Abstract/2010/07000/A_Prospective_Randomized_Controlled_Trial_of_an.7.aspx">A Prospective Randomized Controlled Trial of an Interpersonal Violence Prevention Program With a Mexican American Community</a>.</p>
<p>If a community’s challenges are viewed without consideration of the historical context of the impact of oppression, discrimination, and intergenerational trauma, they may be misunderstood and therefore be addressed in ways that perpetrate the problems rather than produce lasting change.<span id="more-10364"></span></p>
<p>I had met the lead author Patricia Kelly several years ago at an <a href="http://www.apha.org/">American Public Health Association</a> conference where she impressed me with her community centered approaches to violence prevention. She later joined a <a href="http://www.preventconnect.org/display/displayTextItems.cfm?itemID=164&amp;sectionID=248" class="broken_link">PreventConnect web conference on measuring prevention</a>.</p>
<p>As I read this article about a<strong> </strong>Community-Based Participatory Research project in South Texas, I was pleased to see how the program was developed.  Instead of having the researchers select a curriculum to evaluation in a selected community, CBPR is a process in which the researchers work with the community members to design, implement and evaluate the program.</p>
<p>After careful consideration the community members decided to implement <em>El Joven Noble</em>, a curriculum developed in California by <a href="http://www.preventconnect.org/display/displayTextItems.cfm?itemID=287&amp;sectionID=248" class="broken_link">Jerry Tello (who was recently a guest on a PreventConnect web conference) </a>and was adapted to address the community in South Texas</p>
<p>This process of having community members play an active role with researchers is a model that sexual violence and domestic violence prevention programs should consider. (In New York City, <a href="http://calcasa.org/prevention/envisioning-communities-free-of-sexual-violence/">Project ENVISION is using CBPR approaches</a>.) By having this active community engagement, the community member were able to shape a culturally relevant program with community support that demonstrated improvements in nonviolent self-efficacy and endorsement of program values.</p>
<p>As the authors conclude:</p>
<blockquote><p>CBPR provides a methodology to engage groups and communities in the design, implemenataion, and evaluation of their own prevention programs. It is well suited for the inlcuison of community values, cultural heritate and hostrorical perspective into both the research process and the product. CBPR also emphasizes the empowerment of inidivudals and communities through the research process.</p></blockquote>

<p>Using methods of community-based participatory research, a prospective randomized controlled trial of a violence prevention program based on Latino cultural values was implemented with elementary school children in a Mexican American community. Community members participated in intervention program selection, implementation, and data collection. High-risk students who participated in the program had greater nonviolent self-efficacy and demonstrated greater endorsement of program values than did high-risk students in the control group. This collaborative partnership was able to combine community-based participatory research with a rigorous study design and provide sustained benefit to community partners.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I think everyone who researches domestic violence and sexual violence can learn something from the approach used in a recently epublished <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0886260510370591" class="broken_link">study</a> on bullying in the <em>Journal of Interpersonal Violence</em>.  What is interesting to me is the researchers focus on the different levels that contribute to bullying.  Instead of focusing primarily on individual factors, this study adapts Bronfenbrenner’s  ecological system model.</p>
<p>Here are levels examined:<span id="more-9992"></span></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Children Themselves</em>: Examines individual factors</li>
<li><em>Microsystem</em>: experience within interpersonal relationships.</li>
<li><em>Mesosystem</em>: social interconnections between participants, such as students, teachers, and peers.</li>
<li><em>Exosystem</em>: “encompasses the linkage and processes taking place between two or more settings, at least one of which does not ordinarily contain the developing person . . . (e.g., for a child, the relation between the home and the parent’s work place)” (Bronfenbrenner, U. (1989). Ecological systems theory. In R. Vasta (Ed.), <em>Annals of child development</em> (Vol. 6, pp. 197­249). Greenwich, CT: JAI Press. p. 227)</li>
<li><em>Macrosystem</em>: societal characteristics, such as individualism and collectivism (Nesdale &amp; Naito, 2005) and social disorganization</li>
</ul>
<p>How do you think this would apply to sexual violence and domestic violence?</p>
<p>Here is the full abstract and link to the article on the journal’s web site:</p>

<p><strong>An Ecological Systems Approach to Bullying Behaviors Among Middle School Students in the United States.</strong></p>

<p>The aim of this study is to identify an ecological prediction model of bullying behaviors. Based on an ecological systems theory, this study identifies significant factors influencing bullying behaviors at different levels of middle and high school. These levels include the microsystem, mesosystem, exosystem, and macrosystem. More specifically, the ecological factors investigated in this multilevel analysis are individual traits, family experiences, parental involvement, school climate, and community characteristics. Using data collected in 2008 from 485 randomly selected students in a school district, this study identifies a best-fitting structural model of bullying behavior. Findings suggest that the ecological model accounted for a high portion of variance in bullying behaviors. All of the ecological systems as well as individual traits were found to be significant influences on bullying behaviors either directly or indirectly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Being a parent of a middle school student has given me a lot ot worry about: drugs, sex and violence.  As a parent, I realize that we must start early if we are to prevent dating violence. Yet, many dating violence prevention efforts address high school students, but the pattern of violence often starts before then.  In an <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0272431609333301" class="broken_link">article</a> recently published in the <em>Journal of Early Adolescence</em>, 60% of 6<sup>th</sup> grade males and 45% of  6<sup>th</sup> grade females (45.2%)  reported having a boy or girlfriend in previous 3 months. Among those students reporting having a boy/girlfriend, almost 1/3 of girls and more than ¼ of boys reported being physically aggressive toward their boy/girlfriend.<span id="more-9597"></span></p>
<p>Teen dating violence prevention efforts like <a href="http://www.startstrongteens.org/">Start Strong</a> highlight working with middle school age youth. It seems to me even more important now than ever to start early.</p>
<p>Note: The instrument used to measure the levels of violence was modified from the instrument used to evaluate <a href="http://www.hazelden.org/web/go/safedates">Safe Dates</a>.  I have trouble reconciling the finding that males are more likely than females to be victimized.  What do you think is going on?</p>
<p>Here is the full citation and link the article on the journal’s web site.</p>
<p><strong>Physical Dating Violence Norms and Behavior Among Sixth-Grade Students From Four U.S. Sites.</strong></p>
<p>Simon TR, Miller S, Gorman-Smith D, Orpinas P, Sullivan T. <em>Journal of Early Adolescence</em><strong> </strong>2010; 30(3): 395-409.</p>
<p>Click <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0272431609333301" class="broken_link">here</a> for a link to the article on the journal’s web site.</p>
<p>(Copyright © 2010, Sage Publications)</p>
<p>Relatively little is known about the prevalence of physical dating violence behaviors and perceived norms about dating violence among early adolescents. A sample of 5,404 sixth-grade students was recruited from four diverse U.S. sites. Over half of the respondents reported that girls hitting their boyfriends was acceptable under certain circumstances (e.g., if made mad or jealous) and more than one in four reported acceptance of boys hitting their girlfriends. Among those reporting that they had a recent boy/ girlfriend, nearly one third of girls (31.5%) and more than one fourth of boys (26.4%) reported being physically aggressive toward this person (e.g., punching, slapping). These data support the need to address the problem of violence within students’ perceived dating relationships in sixth grade or earlier and suggest that preventive interventions should focus on changing norms that support violence between males and females.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If he buys her dinner, does he expect that they will have sex?  If he rapes her after dinner,  who is blamed for the rape?  In an <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0886260510363421" class="broken_link">article</a> recently ePublished in the <em>Journal of Interpersonal Violence</em>, Basow and Minieri examine questions like this.</p>
<p>I remember many surveys of high school and college students over the last several decades that show similar disturbing, and unsurprising, findings.<span id="more-9594"></span> Here is another study (with data collected from a private Northeastern liberal arts school) to add to this knowledge base about social expectation on a date.</p>
<p>What are the implications for rape prevention?  Would splitting the bill reduce rape? I am glad that rape is no longer assumed to be committed by a “stranger jumping out of bushes” but the concept of  “date rape” might be also dated. We live in a time period where young people do use the term “dating.”   What are the implications of this for rape prevention?</p>
<p>Here is the full abstract and citation.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;You Owe Me&#8221;: Effects of Date Cost, Who Pays, Participant Gender, and Rape Myth Beliefs on Perceptions of Rape.</strong></p>
<p>Basow SA, Minieri A. <em> Journal of Interpersonal Violence</em> 2010; ePublished May 4, 2010</p>
<p>Click here for a <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0886260510363421" class="broken_link">link</a> to the article on the journal’s web site.</p>
<p>(Copyright © 2010, Sage Publications)</p>
<p>Sexual social exchange theory was applied to perceptions of a date rape by manipulating the cost of the date and who paid in vignettes presented to 188 U.S. college students, who then rated the characters&#8217; sexual expectations, blame, responsibility, and rape justifiability. Findings from this between-participant design partially supported predictions: When the man paid for an expensive date, men agreed more than did women that both characters should have expected sexual intercourse. Conversely, when the costs of an inexpensive date were split, the perpetrator was assigned the most blame, and women agreed more than men that no sexual expectations were warranted. Participant gender affected some responses, although level of rape myth acceptance was the main predictor of rape perceptions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I find the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/ncipc/dvp/social-ecological-model_DVP.htm">social ecological model</a> to be a helpful framework to highlight that prevention work needs to look beyond the individual.  So I am pleased to see research that examines risk and protective factors that go beyond individual attitudes, beliefs and experiences.</p>
<p>In the recent <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10964-009-9423-y">article</a> appearing in the <em>Journal of Youth and Adolescence</em>, authors Casey and Beadnell examine the links between male adolescent peer networks and the risk to perpetrate intimate partner violence.  Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (initially collected in 1995 on teen peer networks and in 2001 for IPV perpetration), this study explores different peer networks for male teens.<span id="more-9591"></span></p>
<p>While the results are uneven (some relationship were shown while other were not), Casey and Beadnell suggest</p>
<blockquote><p>…some peer-level factors did emerge as relevant to IPV perpetration, which suggests that selected prevention programming targeting specific risk factors at the peer level may be warranted. Speci?cally, depressed, socially isolated youth in small, dense male networks appeared to be at greater risk of future perpetration than youth with much more numerous, gender-balanced, pro- social ties. It may be that structural prevention programs that aim to reduce some teens’ social isolation, build social competencies and generate positive opportunities for exposure to variety of peers may expand the range of behaviors, attitudes and relationship expectations to which youth are exposed.</p></blockquote>
<p>I support research that challenges prevention programs to make changes to social networks as a means to change.  What do you think?</p>
<p>The full citation and abstract follow:</p>
<p><strong>The structure of male adolescent peer networks and risk for intimate partner violence perpetration: findings from a national sample.</strong></p>

<p>Although peer networks have been implicated as influential in a range of adolescent behaviors, little is known about relationships between peer network structures and risk for intimate partner violence (IPV) among youth. This study is a descriptive analysis of how peer network &#8220;types&#8221; may be related to subsequent risk for IPV perpetration among adolescents using data from 3,030 male respondents to the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Sampled youth were a mean of 16 years of age when surveyed about the nature of their peer networks, and 21.9 when asked to report about IPV perpetration in their adolescent and early adulthood relationships. A latent class analysis of the size, structure, gender composition and delinquency level of friendship groups identified four unique profiles of peer network structures. Men in the group type characterized by small, dense, mostly male peer networks with higher levels of delinquent behavior reported higher rates of subsequent IPV perpetration than men whose adolescent network type was characterized by large, loosely connected groups of less delinquent male and female friends. Other factors known to be antecedents and correlates of IPV perpetration varied in their distribution across the peer group types, suggesting that different configurations of risk for relationship aggression can be found across peer networks. Implications for prevention programming and future research are addressed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I wish reading research were a simple process of learning new knowledge. Instead, I have to consider the research question, methodology, strategy to select the sample, recognize the limitations of the research and evaluate the relevance to the practice of sexual violence and domestic violence prevention. And sometimes I cannot understand things like this chart below.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://calcasa.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/vulnerable-adolescent-graphic1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9214" title="vulnerable adolescent graphic" src="http://calcasa.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/vulnerable-adolescent-graphic1.jpg" alt="" width="575" height="445" /></a></p>
<p>Here is my weekly routine:<span id="more-9210"></span>I review the summary of abstracts from recently published research as compiled by <a href="http://www.safetylit.org">Safety Lit</a>.  I read the title of each violence related study. For those that catch my interest, I read the abstract.  From those studies, I work with my colleagues at the <a href="http://www.nsvrc.org">National Sexual Violence Resource Center</a> to get copies of the article that have appear to have implications for prevention practice.</p>
<p>Then I learn that the conclusion does not always fit what was actually studied. Or that I cannot figure out how the research leads to the conclusion.</p>
<p>I am not a researcher.  During my studies for my masters degree I learned to be a good consumer of research. I interpret research and know many of the questions to ask.  But I am not an expert on statistical methods nor am I always able to understand how they actually did the research.</p>
<p>This week I saw the interesting title of an article, <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chiabu.2009.10.005">Vulnerable adolescent participants&#8217; experience in surveys on sexuality and sexual abuse: Ethical aspects</a> from the journal <em>Child Abuse and Neglect</em>.  This study explores an important question about the possible discomfort of adolescents when they participate in a survey about sexuality and sexual abuse.</p>
<p>But as read the analysis, I do not understand what they are doing. This might be excellent research; but its methodology is too much for my skills to understand. If I cannot read research, what about people who have even less experience with research.  My colleagues at <a href="http://www.vawnet.org">VAWnet</a> create Applied Research papers to address this – but we need to understand research.</p>
<p>What do you do to understand research?</p>
<p>The abstract and full citation of the article follows.</p>
<p><strong>Vulnerable adolescent participants&#8217; experience in surveys on sexuality and sexual abuse: Ethical aspects.</strong></p>
<p>Priebe G, Bäckström M, Ainsaar M. <em>Child Abuse and Neglect</em> 2010; ePublished April 18, 2010</p>
<p>Click <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chiabu.2009.10.005">here</a> for a link the article on the journal’s web site.</p>
<p>(Copyright © 2010, Elsevier Publishing)</p>
<blockquote><p>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this research was to study the discomfort experienced by adolescents when answering questions in a survey about sexuality and sexual abuse and to investigate factors that may determine possible experience of discomfort. The research focused particularly on vulnerable adolescents-sexually abused and sexually inexperienced.</p>
<p>METHOD: Adolescents in their final year of high school in Estonia (n=1,334) and Sweden (n=3,401) who had completed a survey about experiences of sexuality and sexual abuse answered additional questions about experiences of discomfort related to the survey questions.</p>
<p>RESULTS: A majority of the participants did not feel discomfort when completing the survey. This was also the case for the two vulnerable groups. Experience of penetrating sexual abuse, sexual inexperience, mental health problems, rape myth acceptance, gender, immigrant background, and country were included in a structural equation model. Experience of penetrating sexual abuse was not significantly related to discomfort in the final model, while sexual inexperience was associated with increased discomfort (standardized coefficient .20) and rape myth acceptance was the strongest indicator of discomfort (.27). The total amount of explained variance was 17%.</p>
<p>CONCLUSIONS: Our data do not support the view that adolescents in general or vulnerable subgroups such as sexually abused or sexually inexperienced adolescents experience discomfort when answering a survey about sexuality and sexual abuse. As discomfort ratings were not highly related to any of the predictors further research is needed that includes other factors. It is important to follow existing ethical guidelines since there may always be some individuals who feel discomfort.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11121-010-0176-3">study</a> recently ePublished in the Journal <em>Prevention Science</em>, the authors Woodin and O’Leary examine a violence prevention program for couples with a history of at least one act of male-to-female physical violence in the current relationship.</p>
<p>Domestic violence advocates warn against activities that may place someone at great risk, such as couple-based interventions. <span id="more-9205"></span> This program includes an assessment that includes interviewing both partners together.</p>
<p>The study finds the use of motivational interviewing to reduce future physical aggression (as compared to those who receive “minimal non-motivational” feedback.)</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>The full citation and abstract follow:</p>
<p><strong>A Brief Motivational Intervention for Physically Aggressive Dating Couples.</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>Motivational interviewing is a brief non-confrontational intervention designed to enhance motivation to reduce harmful behavior (Miller and Rollnick 2002). The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of motivational interviewing as a targeted prevention approach for partner aggression in emerging adulthood. Participants were 50 college dating couples between 18 and 25 years old who reported at least one act of male-to-female physical aggression in their current relationships. After completing a 2-hour assessment session, half of all couples were randomly assigned to a 2-hour individualized motivational feedback session targeting physical aggression and risk factors for aggression. The remaining couples received minimal, non-motivational feedback. Follow-up surveys were conducted 3, 6, and 9 months later. Hierarchical linear modeling analyses indicated that, compared to the control condition, the motivational feedback intervention led to reductions in physical aggression and harmful alcohol use and to less acceptance of female psychological aggression and male psychological aggression (among women only). Lagged analyses indicated that changes in physical aggression were predicted by reductions in psychological aggression and by lower acceptance of both male and female psychological aggression. Reductions in physical aggression predicted lower anxiety and greater relationship investment and male relationship commitment over time. These findings suggest that a brief motivational intervention is a useful prevention approach for high-risk dating couples, with benefits to both individual and relationship functioning.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is great to see an article in the <em>Journal of The Medical Association of Thailand </em>that calls for a nation wide school-based program to promote gender equity to prevent sexual violence.  When will we see this in the United States?</p>
<p>The full citation, abstract and link to full text follow the jump.<span id="more-9172"></span></p>
<p><strong>Gender roles, physical and sexual violence prevention in primary extend to secondary school in Samutsakorn Province, Thailand.</strong></p>
<p>Chamroonsawasdi K, Suparp J, Kittipichai W, Khajornchaikul P. <em>Journal of The Medical Association of Thailand </em>2010; 93(3): 358-65.</p>
<p>Click <a href="http://www.mat.or.th/journal/files/Vol93_No.3_358_1775.pdf" class="broken_link">here</a> for full text.</p>
<p>(Copyright © 2010, Medical Association of Thailand)</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE: To enhance positive attitude and life skills on gender roles to prevent physical and sexual violence.</p>
<p>MATERIAL AND METHOD: A whole school-based participatory learning program using a quasi-experimental study with pre and post test design was conducted among 2 schools during June-September, 2005. The experimental group, were 134 students in a primary school and 179 students in a secondary school. While the control group, were 122 students in a primary school and 95 students in secondary school.</p>
<p>RESULTS: Means score of attitude toward gender roles before implementation in the experimental group was significantly lower than the control group (p &lt; 0.05). After implementation, the means score in the experimental group was not significantly different from the control group (p &gt; 0.05). Means paired different score (after-before) between the two groups was significantly different (p = 0.002).</p>
<p>CONCLUSION: A whole school-based program on gender roles and violence prevention is suitable for youths and should be merged as school curricula and expanded as a nationwide program at all level of education. Gender equity should be taught at an early childhood. Parental involvement in school-based activities should be negotiated.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Each week I review summaries of the titles and abstracts for newly published articles to find research relevant to prevention of sexual violence and domestic violence. Yet, without reading the article, I will not know how they came to those findings. Here is an example of the methods used for a study recently published in the <em>I</em><em>nternational Journal of Offender Therapy and Comparative Criminology </em>titled <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0306624X10365083" class="broken_link">Understanding Men&#8217;s Perceptions of Risks and Rewards in a Date Rape Scenario</a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-8996"></span>This study was conducted by looking how college males respond to a scenario where after picking up a women with a reputation for being “loose” and being “pretty drunk” they go to her apartment:</p>
<blockquote><p>After listening to music for a few minutes, Susan turns down the lights and begins to kiss you and rub your penis through your pants. In response, you begin to kiss and fondle Susan’s breasts. You then reach under her skirt and begin to attempt to remove Susan’s clothes. Susan tells you that she thinks she is not interested in having sex but does not try to physically stop you.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>The researchers then examined the men’s perceptions of potential costs and benefits associated with having sex in this hypothetical situation. (The scenario was presented after being exposed to either viewing photographs of fully clothed models, photographs of nude women or 10-minute segment of video that depicted an adult male and adult female engaging in consensual intercourse.) The researchers found</p>
<blockquote><p>75% of the men reporting the possibility of legal consequences (including arrest, rape charges, conviction, and a jail or prison sentence). Participants also indicated potential positive outcomes of having sex with Susan in this situation, and nearly 29% of the respondents reported some type of future romantic or sexual relationship with her.</p></blockquote>
<p>The researchers use a “rational choice perspective” to understand how men perceive costs and benefits. While the study does not examine actual behaviors, the researchers suggest that the behavior intentions are important to predict future action.</p>
<p>It is helpful to understand how the researchers came to their conclusion of implications for prevention:</p>
<blockquote><p>Achieving longer-term attitudinal and behavioral change may require a broader focus not just on changing attitudes but on changing the perception of risks and rewards of sexual aggression.</p></blockquote>
<p>What do you think about the method of this study? Do you think that behavior is primarily influenced by perceptions of risks and rewards?</p>
<p>Below is the full citation and abstract:</p>
<p><strong>Understanding Men&#8217;s Perceptions of Risks and Rewards in a Date Rape Scenario.</strong></p>
<p>Bouffard LA, Bouffard JA.<em> I</em><em>nternational Journal of Offender Therapy and Comparative Criminology </em><em> </em>2010; ePublished April 2, 2010.</p>

<p>(Copyright © 2010, Sage Publications)</p>
<p>Existing research on date rape has identified important correlations between rape-supportive attitudes and sexual aggression. What remains unclear is the mechanism by which these attitudes are translated into sexually aggressive behavior. This study borrows from a rational choice framework to explore the relationship between attitudes, perceptions of the risks and rewards of engaging in date rape, and self-reported hypothetical aggression in a date rape scenario. Results suggest that rape-supportive attitudes are related to particular patterns of identified risks and rewards of date rape as well as to the self-reported likelihood of engaging in date rape behavior. This supports a perspective that certain attitude structures may alter the risks and rewards that potential offenders consider in deciding whether or not to engage in sexual aggression. Implications for future research and prevention programs are discussed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0886260510363418" class="broken_link">study</a> recently ePublished in the <em>Journal of Interpersonal Violence</em>, the authors found for women students an association between non-consensual sexual experiences prior to arriving at college and drinking behaviors after the first year of college.  Though the publication reads 2010, the study is based on data collected in 1991.</p>
<p>The discussion describes implications for prevention efforts. When the authors suggest “campus-sponsored sexual assault prevention presentations typically do not discuss alcohol as a risk factor” based on a 1991 publication, it does not really provide information that is helpful today.</p>
<p>What I really want to see is more research on prevention programs themselves.  Hopefully this will be the follow-up study.</p>

<p>The authors investigated the relationship between pre-college non-consensual sexual experiences (NSEs) and drinking among women entering college. College women (N = 797) at a midwestern university in the USA participated. Eighteen percent reported one or more NSE prior to arriving at college. Having a pre-college NSE was associated with recent drinking, binge drinking, and negative drinking consequences. The authors discuss implications for intervention and prevention programs targeting college women.</p>

<p>Objective: To examine the prevalence of drug-related sexual assaults, identify the frequency of assaults that occur following voluntary versus involuntary drug or alcohol consumption, and identify contextual correlates of drug-related assaults. Participants: College-student females (n = 314). Methods: Volunteers reported experiences with forcible and drug-related sexual assaults in the spring semester of 2004. Follow-up queries regarding the most severe drug-related assaults determined whether the assaults followed voluntary or involuntary alcohol or drug consumption. Results: 29.6% (n = 93) of the respondents reported a drug-related sexual assault or rape; 5.4% (n = 17) reported a forcible sexual assault or rape. Voluntary incapacitation preceded 84.6% of drug-related assaults and involuntary incapacitation preceded 15.4% of drug-related assaults. The majority of drug-related assaults (96.1%) involved alcohol consumption prior to assault. Conclusions: Drug-related sexual assaults on college campuses are more frequent than are forcible assaults and are most frequently preceded by voluntary alcohol consumption.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the article recently published in the journal <em>International Journal of Offender Therapy and Comparative Criminology</em>, the author Pradubmook-Sherer examines the relationships of many factors to attitudes about dating violence among Thai youth.  The factors examined include class (using school type as the proxy), delinquency, self-esteem and school performance.</p>
<p>In the conclusion, Pradubmook-Sherer discussed the implication for prevention programs:</p>
<blockquote><p>Educational programs that confront students’ beliefs that violence is an acceptable response in dating relationships must be established. Intervention programs on these issues and on gender relationships should start even before high school. Because of the indicated cultural and gender differences, we recommend that culturally sensitive intervention programs should target specific groups, according to their special needs, in the area of dating violence.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>This study assessed the occurrences and intensity of psychological, physical, and sexual attitudes toward dating violence among Thai youths, and examined possible variables related to the formation of these attitudes. The random sample consisted of 1,296 male and female adolescents from high school, vocational school, and out-of-school groups. Thai youths in general reported attitudes that were supportive of dating violence. The variables more closely related to attitudes toward dating violence were personal variables. Peer influence, partner relationships, and family characteristics were related to higher support for dating violence. Females reported higher endorsement of dating violence than males. The theoretical and practical implications of the results are discussed, and recommendations for policy makers are drawn.</p></blockquote>

<div><strong>Project Title: Adolescent Dating Violence: Development of a Theoretical Framework</strong></div>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>Dating violence among adolescents is a prevalent public health problem with serious proximal and distal effects, including increased risk for adult intimate partner violence. An in-depth explanatory theory that is focused on the development of dating violence during adolescence and informed by the perspective of those who have experienced adolescent dating violence has not been developed. The lack of theory has hindered efforts to develop dating violence prevention programs that show evidence of long-term efficacy. The purpose of the proposed research is to use an innovative, qualitative research design to develop a theoretical framework that describes, explains, and predicts how dating violence unfolds during adolescence. The specific aims are to:</p>
<ul>
<li>a) Identify common processes by which adolescents respond to their experiences of dating violence from a narrative/life course perspective,</li>
<li>b) Develop a typology of common trajectories of violent events that occur over the course of adolescent dating relationships from a situational/events perspective,</li>
<li>c) Examine the influence of social circumstances on adolescents’ experiences of dating violence, and</li>
<li>d) Use grounded theory methods to analyze and integrate information about the processes, trajectories, and influential social circumstances in order to create the theoretical framework.</li>
</ul>
<p>The project will be conducted by a collaborative team of university and community-based researchers. Women and men between the ages of 18 and 21 living in one of 12 Summit, Medina, or Portage counties in Ohio who have experienced dating violence as adolescents will be recruited by a community-based recruitment strategy developed by the researchers. In-depth interviews will be used to obtain narratives of the participants’ responses to dating violence and detailed descriptions of the violent events they experienced. These data will be supplemented by narratives of professionals who work with adolescents at risk for dating violence and information regarding community responses to dating violence. Grounded theory methods will be used to analyze the data and develop the theoretical framework. The university / community collaborative research team, with the assistance of a consultant who is a world renowned expert on interpersonal violence, will determine the implications of the theory for prevention efforts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here are two articles published at the end of 2009 with the opposite conclusions about the influence of <a href="http://calcasa.org/prevention/pornography-and-attitudes-supporting-violence-against-women/">pornography on sexual assault</a>.</p>
<p>While in a 2009 <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.avb.2009.04.008">article</a> in the journal <em>Aggression and Violent Behavior</em>, Ferguson and Hartley argue that<strong> “</strong>it is time to discard the hypothesis that pornography contributes to increased sexual assault behavior” the 2009 <a href="http://www.xyonline.net/content/harms-pornography-exposure-among-children-and-young-people">article</a> ePublished in the journal <em>Child Abuse Review</em> author Michael Flood comes to a very different conclusion: “especially among boys and young men who are frequent consumers of pornography, including of more violent materials, consumption intensifies attitudes supportive of sexual coercion and increases their likelihood of perpetrating assault.”</p>
<p><span id="more-8420"></span></p>
<p>What research, evidence and resources do you find useful to understand the influence of pornography on rape? How do you address pornography in your rape prevention program?</p>
<p>Below are the full abstracts and citation of the articles.</p>
<p><strong>The harms of pornography exposure among children and young people </strong></p>
<p>Flood, M.<strong> </strong><em>Child Abuse Review</em> 2009 18 (6): 384–400, ePublished November 2, 2009</p>

<blockquote><p>Exposure to pornography is routine among children and young people, with a range of notable and often troubling effects. Particularly among younger children, exposure to pornography may be disturbing or upsetting. Exposure to pornography helps to sustain young people’s adherence to sexist and unhealthy notions of sex and relationships. And, especially among boys and young men who are frequent consumers of pornography, including of more violent materials, consumption intensifies attitudes supportive of sexual coercion and increases their likelihood of perpetrating assault. While children and young people are sexual beings and deserve age-appropriate materials on sex and sexuality, pornography is a poor, and indeed dangerous, sex educator.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>The pleasure is momentary&#8230;the expense damnable?: The influence of pornography on rape and sexual assault.</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>The effects of pornography, whether violent or non-violent, on sexual aggression have been debated for decades. The current review examines evidence about the influence of pornography on sexual aggression in correlational and experimental studies and in real world violent crime data. Evidence for a causal relationship between exposure to pornography and sexual aggression is slim and may, at certain times, have been exaggerated by politicians, pressure groups and some social scientists. Some of the debate has focused on violent pornography, but evidence of any negative effects is inconsistent, and violent pornography is comparatively rare in the real world. Victimization rates for rape in the United States demonstrate an inverse relationship between pornography consumption and rape rates. Data from other nations have suggested similar relationships. Although these data cannot be used to determine that pornography has a cathartic effect on rape behavior, combined with the weak evidence in support of negative causal hypotheses from the scientific literature, it is concluded that it is time to discard the hypothesis that pornography contributes to increased sexual assault behavior.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the recently published study in the <em>Journal of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psycholo</em><em>gy</em> <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15374410902976270">Parent and peer predictors of physical dating violence perpetration in early adolescence: tests of moderation and gender differences</a>, the authors find some potentially important difference between adolescent males and females linked to dating violence:</p>
<blockquote><p>Whereas parental involvement was unrelated to physical dating aggression for girls, boys who reported that their parents monitored them more closely reported lower levels of perpetration. A contrasting gendered pattern was shown for parental support for nonaggressive solutions. Girls (but not boys) who perceived their parents’ to be more supportive of non- aggressive solutions reported lower levels of PPDV.</p></blockquote>
<p>This study suggests that prevention programs should recognize that some factors are different for boys and girls.  Thus, prevention programs cannot use “one size fits all” and need to tailor its messages.</p>
<p>Very interesting concepts.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>P.S. The researchers use a seven question measure to find that</p>
<blockquote><p>Among the dating youth, 29% (15% of the total sample) reported perpetrating at least one act of physical violence against their boyfriend=girlfriend. A greater proportion of girls (31%) than boys (27%) reported perpetrating at least one act of partner violence.</p></blockquote>
<p>Interesting to see just as I read <a href="http://calcasa.org/prevention/losing-the-gender-in-gender-based-violence/">Losing the &#8220;gender&#8221; in gender-based violence</a> this week about just this point.</p>

<p>This study examined parenting and peer predictors of physical dating violence perpetration during early adolescence and tested moderation among these predictors and gender. Participants were 2,824 ethnically diverse sixth-grade students with a recent boyfriend/girlfriend who was part of a multisite, longitudinal investigation of the development and prevention of violence among middle school students. Those students who reported having a boyfriend/girlfriend reported significantly more drug use and delinquent activity and were more likely to be male. Twenty-nine percent of youth with a boyfriend/girlfriend reported perpetrating physical aggression against their boyfriend/girlfriend. Parenting and peer variables were significant predictors of physical dating violence. However, gender moderated the association between parenting practices and physical dating violence, with parental monitoring inversely linked to dating violence for boys and parent support for nonaggression inversely linked to dating violence for girls. Parent support for aggression also moderated the association between peer deviancy and reported perpetration. Finally, gender moderated the interaction between peer deviancy and parent support for nonaggressive solutions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gender based violence is a term used throughout the world. That is, used everywhere except the United States.  Here we use a wide range of terms: domestic violence, intimate partner violence and dating violence (usually used to describe young people’s relationships).</p>
<p>In a <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1077801209361127" class="broken_link">commentary in the recent issue of </a><em><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1077801209361127" class="broken_link">Violence Against Women</a><span id="more-8323"></span></em>, Elizabeth Reed and colleagues express concern about “losing the ‘gender’ in gender-based violence.” They go further to describe this problem as “the missteps of research on dating and intimate partner violence” which “ignores the world beyond our databases.”</p>
<p>Reed and her colleagues review the literature and suggest that</p>
<blockquote><p>it is clear why the WHO and other major health authorities describe IPV as gender based, with the vast burden in regards to health, development, and economic security borne by women and girls.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yet, they found in a review of the literature on dating violence, an overwhelmingly large percentage of the research is framed as gender-neutral where violence is often seen as reciprocal. I have found this pattern to be true as I review the recent research studies.  When I wrote a blog about this research I often highlight what the instrument was used, as the Revised Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS2) which measures primarily a count of acts and does not account for the context. Scales like this typically lead to findings described as gender neutral. (Click <a href="http://new.vawnet.org/category/Main_Doc.php?docid=388" class="broken_link">here</a> for a critique of this scale.)</p>
<p>I especially like how Reed and her colleagues describe the problem with this approach.</p>
<blockquote><p>Use of this “reciprocal violence” framework for understanding adolescent and adult IPV ignores the world beyond our databases. We should not frame and interpret research in the absence of well-accepted historical and political realities. That is not to say that both males and females cannot or do not enact unhealthy relationship behaviors, including aggression or that such unhealthy relationship behaviors do not negatively impact both males and females. Such behaviors, however, likely have differing etiologies and are displayed differently based on the gender of the actors.</p></blockquote>
<p>This commentary provides some useful concepts to consider when reviewing research on dating violence.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The web site has replaced the brochure as the primary public statement about organizations.  How times have changed – I remember in the 1990s when working at a domestic violence agency I tried to get permission to start a web site.  While approval was delayed (I was asked “why do we need a web site?”), I decided to ask for forgiveness (nor permission), and went ahead to work with a volunteer to register the URL ourselves and set up a simple site.</p>
<p>Now the first thing to learn about an organization (or a person) we is check the web site.  In a recent paper in the journal <em>Sexualities</em>,<strong> </strong>Tatiana Masters analyzes the content of six men’s anti-rape web sites<span id="more-7995"></span> (<a href="http://www.menagainstsexualviolence.org/">Men Against Sexual Violence</a>, <a href="http://www.mencanstoprape.org">Men Can Stop Rape</a>, <a href="http://www.vahealth.org/injury/sexualviolence/menendingviolence/" class="broken_link">Men Ending Violence</a>, <a href="http://www.men-stopping-rape.org/">Men Stopping Rape</a>, <a href="http://www.thesafetynet.org/index.cfm?id=1">The Safety Net</a> and <a href="http://www.walkamileinhershoes.org/">Walk a Mile in Her Shoes</a>.)</p>
<p>In today’s era of blogs and fast changing content, web site are not necessarily static – they may change content everyday (as we do here at CALCASA.org). Content analysis done in the past may not be relevant today.</p>
<p>It is interesting to look at the question of how men and rape is framed in web sites, as the author examines. Masters suggests in her conclusion that “Making men both part of the problem and part of the solution in this way could lead to more powerful anti-rape messages.”</p>
<p>What are you looking for in web site focusing on men and rape prevention?</p>

<p>Acquaintance sexual assault prevention in the USA has largely comprised educational programs for women on college campuses and has left an unmet need for interventions targeted at men in the general community. Men’s anti-rape websites attempt to address this need. This article describes a sample of six such sites and examines them for insights into the social discourses on masculinity and male sexuality that they both produce and reflect. Findings indicate that these sites construct alternative masculinities, using socio-sexual behavior to delineate the boundary between ‘good’/non-rapist and ‘bad’/rapist masculinity, and use the rhetorical strategy of othering the rapist, with a few interesting exceptions. Sites’ depictions of consensual sex and rape are also briefly described. Implications of these discourses for rape prevention are discussed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I review the new research published each week on sexual violence and intimate partner violence, sometimes I feel a tension between trusting science and trusting my own beliefs.  There are times that existing research indicates something that I do not believe. In those moments I have to reevaluate my beliefs and determine where I stand.  Sometimes current research will shift my thinking; and there are times that a research study does not convince me, either because the research was framed problematically, is limited in its scope, and/or is not answering the crucial question.</p>
<p>This brings me to a recent <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0886260509354881" class="broken_link">study <span id="more-7898"></span>on rape prevention written by Foubert et. al</a>. ePublished in the <em>Journal of Interpersonal Violence</em>.  This study examines <a href="http://www.oneinfourusa.org/themensprogram.php">The Men’s Program</a>, which is described in this study as had having long-term success in changing men’s attitudes and behaviors about rape (according to studies previously conducted by Foubert et. al.)</p>
<p>The program is designed to increase men’s empathy with survivors of sexual assault.  Here is the description of the program from the article:</p>
<blockquote><p>…presenters of The Men’s Program show a <a href="http://www.oneinfourusa.org/products.php">DVD</a> describing a male-on-male rape experience designed to teach men how a rape experience might feel describing a male-on- male rape experience designed to teach men how a rape experience might feel. After the video is shown, presenters process the video, noting the presumably heterosexual orientation of the perpetrators… and they follow this by making connections between a male-on-male and a male-on-female rape experience to facilitate empathy toward rape survivors. Later, men are taught how to support a rape survivor. Men then learn the basics of defining sexual consent and hear strategies for confronting peers as bystanders when they overhear others tell jokes about rape, act in ways that demean women, or brag about abusing women. Following that, men are taken through a guided imagery of a woman close to them who experiences rape under the influence of alcohol while a bystander watches and does nothing. … Participants then brainstorm ways that they could intervene in situations where an alcohol-related rape might occur. The program itself lasts about 1 hr and is usually presented by four undergraduate male peer educators, often part of peer education groups named <a href="http://www.oneinfourusa.org/index.php">One in Four</a>…</p></blockquote>
<p>I am uncomfortable with this program.  The <a href="http://www.oneinfourusa.org/products.php">video</a> used in it was designed to train male law enforcement officers to understand what the experience of female victims of sexual assault.  Its graphically highlights the grotesqueness of the rapists and of the actual assault. I can see how the video has impact on male participants as they are guided to consider the experience of being violated. But I am unsure that will lead men to see their own behavior as the same way as the male-on-male stranger rape described in the video.</p>
<p>And I have several questions: Does this video retraumatize men who have been sexually assaulted? Would the homophobia of some men be reinforced by the situation portrayed in the video?</p>
<p>Based on my experiences as a sexual violence prevention educator and the approaches that I am comfortable with, I would not use this video in prevention program.</p>
<p>Yet, in this study and in several other studies Foubert et. al. have demonstrated positive results in reducing rape acceptance myths and decreasing self-reported likelihood of raping.  How do I balance the results of these studies with what I think about the prevention program itself? Do these scientific findings warrant overriding my thoughts on this program?</p>
<p>In my understanding of evidence bases, there are several types of evidence: research based evidence, experiential evidence and contextual evidence.  To understand the use of evidence we need to consider all types, not only evidence from research. (Click <a href="http://www.preventconnect.org/display/displayTextItems.cfm?itemID=232&amp;sectionID=248" class="broken_link">here</a> for a PreventConnect web conference describing of these types of evidence.)</p>
<p>I really like this recent study’s use of qualitative measures to ask college student men about the impact of the program after they participated in a One in Four presentation. (The students were evaluated at the end of their Sophomore year after being exposed to the program as first-year students in September) I share with the researchers the value of gathering data when using the method of asking open questions like “Are any of your attitudes now different as a result of seeing the program?” and “Have there been any situations in which you have behaved any differently in any situation as a result of seeing the program?” These types of questions provide a systematic way to collect information on how a prevention program makes an impact on its participants. In fact, I often recommend this methodology as part of a good strategy to evaluate prevention programs.</p>
<p>When I read this study and reviewed previous research, I had to reexamine my concerns. After considerable reflection, I still remain skeptical about aspects of this program:</p>
<ul>
<li>One hour presentations alone seem unlikely to really change behavior. One hour is not long enough to process both attempts at empathy enhancement and effective bystander intervention skills training. The program&#8217;s bystander training is limited to having participants brainstorm bystander responses. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12971191">Research on effective prevention programs</a> suggests that dosage (the amount of time receiving information) is an important element for useful change in prevention work. I do think that one hour presentations could be a useful piece of a comprehensive prevention effort.</li>
<li>An empathy-based framework for prevention is problematic in sexual violence.  While empathy seem intuitively helpful to understand a victim perspective, it is not clear to me that this approach is what changes a potential perpetrating behavior. Once agin, empathy makes sense to me as part of a prevention effort. </li>
<li>While the authors claim in this article that “…Schewe also reported that depicting a man as a survivor <em>always </em>led to lowering rape myth acceptance or likelihood of raping yet depicting a female survivor in programs for men either increased men’s rape myth acceptance or their likelihood of sexual aggression.” (Italics in original) My review of <a href="http://www.apa.org/pubs/books/431680A.aspx">Schewe’s chapter</a> find only the recommendation that when conducting empathy exercises, interventions should include a male as a victim.  I did not see any claims of <em>always</em> lowering rape myth acceptance or likelihood of sexual aggression. The apparent exaggeration in this study is troublesome to me.</li>
<li>I would like to see more research on this program conducted by an independent researcher in a replicated setting, instead of all of the research conducted only by the developer of the program.</li>
<li>And I don’t like the key element of the prevention program – the use of the video.</li>
</ul>
<p>I want to see effective strategies that lead to men not raping women. I want to see positive results. And I want to use research to improve our prevention efforts.</p>
<p>And I want a program that I can stand behind.</p>
<p>Is The Men’s Program a way to do this? What do you think?</p>

<p>The study conducted involved assessing students from a Southeastern public university during two academic years, after their participation in an all-male sexual assault peer education program. The study findings revealed that 79% of 184 college men reported attitude change, behavior change, or both. Furthermore, a multistage inductive analysis revealed that after seeing The Men&#8217;s Program, men intervened to prevent rapes from happening. Participants also modified their behavior to avoid committing sexual assault when they or a potential partner were under the influence of alcohol. Implications for future research were discussed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a study in the <em>Maternal and Child Health Journal</em>, the authors show the differences between different data sources about sexual assault prevalence.  In particular, the paper contains detailed charts highlighting the differences between the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/brfss/index.htm" class="broken_link">Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)</a> and the <a href="http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/nij/pubs-sum/181867.htm">National Violence Against Women Survey (NVAWS)</a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-7713"></span>Later in 2010 we will get the first estimates from a new survey, the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pub/NISVS.html" class="broken_link">National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Surveillance System</a>. Until then, this article is helpful to understand how surveys collect their data.</p>
<p>Here is the full abstract and the full citation:</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>An Assessment of State Level Sexual Assault Prevalence Estimates.</strong></p>
<p>Potter SJ, Laflamme DJ. Maternal and Child Health Journal 2010; ePublished January 25, 2010</p>
<p>Click <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10995-010-0565-z">here</a> for a link to the abstract on journal&#8217;s web site.</p>
<p>(Copyright © 2010, Springer Science+Business Media)</p>
<p>The purpose of our research is to compare sexual violence prevalence rates from three sources of state level data. Public health officials, legislators and other policymakers often require state-level sexual assault prevalence estimates to justify funding and rationalize both new and ongoing sexual violence prevention programs, as well as programs for victims. We compared survey design and resulting prevalence rates of the three surveys frequently used at the state level: the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), the National Violence Against Women Survey (NVAWS) extrapolations, and replications of the NVAWS. Although the specificity of the questions used in the NVAWS provides a clearer picture of the prevalence of sexual assault than the BRFSS questions, the sexual violence module on the BRFSS survey has the advantage that it is used regularly by some states. Currently available female sexual assault prevalence estimates differ widely at the state level but can be used when interpreted with informed caution. The new National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Surveillance System holds promise for providing better estimates in the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00224490903487588">study</a> recently epublished in the <em>Journal of Sex Research</em>, the authors examined the relationship between sexual assault histories and how much people drank that evening.</p>
<p>In examining research it is important to understand how the study was conducted and understand how much we can generalize the findings in order to integrate the understanding of the research into prevention practice.<span id="more-7342"></span></p>
<p>For this study the data was collected at the San Diego, California border with Tijuana, Mexico. Sexual Assault histories were determined by asking four questions derived from Koss and Oros’ Sexual Experiences Survey:</p>
<ol>
<blockquote>
<li>Have you ever been in a situation where you became so sexually aroused that you could not stop yourself even though the person didn’t want to have sex?</li>
<li>Have you ever persuaded someone to have sexual intercourse with you by giving her drugs or alcohol?</li>
<li>Have you ever persuaded someone to have sexual intercourse with you when she did not really want to by pressuring her with continual arguments?</li>
<li>Have you ever been in a situation where you used some degree of physical force (twisting an arm, holding down, etc.) to try to make a person engage in kissing or petting when they did not want to?</li>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p>The study found that individuals who having sexually assaulted someone in the past drank more during their evening in Tijuana.  However, the study did not demonstrate a link between drinking that evening and committing acts of sexual assault.</p>
<p>Here is the full citation and abstract:</p>
<p><strong>Sexual Assault Histories and Evening Drinking Among Young American Men in a High-Risk Drinking Environment.</strong></p>

<p>This study surveyed young American men traveling to Tijuana, Mexico from San Diego, California for a weekend night out, collecting responses both southbound at the outset of the evening and northbound upon return at the end of the evening. Among 650 males, we examined the relationship between sexual histories and attitudes and alcohol use, both historically and on their night in Tijuana. Respondents with a history of coercing sex drank more in Tijuana and were more likely to binge drink. Although estimating sexual assaults committed by these males on the evening in question was not possible, this research establishes the link between a history of sexual assault and the blood alcohol concentration of young men resulting from an evening in a timeout environment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was reading the new study <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0886260509354880" class="broken_link">Risk Recognition and Intimate Partner Violence</a> thinking about the concept of “risk recognition” – that is ability to detect danger.  And I have questions.<span id="more-7184"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Are these beneficial skills as the authors suggest?</li>
<li>What are the implications of having “risk recognition” as the primary goal of a prevention program?</li>
<li>Does it unintentionally absolve potential perpetrators from responsibility for violence?</li>
<li>Does it unintentionally place the burden for prevention on the potential victim?</li>
<li>How do we responsibility integrate risk reduction strategies into a comprehensive prevention initiative?</li>
</ul>
<p>In this study the authors state the following in their implications section:</p>
<blockquote><p>“However, it is important to note that we are not suggesting that we can train victims to <em>effectively predict</em> such violent behavior, as there is no real way to predict unpredictable behavior (Langford, 1996); this would lead to a false sense of control. We are only suggesting that we may be able to teach victims to <em>recognize</em> abusive behavior—even “minor” forms such as name calling and grabbing—as soon as it occurs.”</p></blockquote>
<p>As I have written before about <a href="http://calcasa.org/prevention/rape_resistance/">feminist self defense</a>, empowering women to take action should be part of a comprehensive prevention effort. What is the role of &#8220;risk recognition&#8221; in this?</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>

<p>The objective of this study was to determine whether female victims of physical forms of intimate partner violence (IPV) displayed deficits in risk recognition, or the ability to detect danger, in physically violent dating encounters. A total of 182 women watched a video depicting a psychologically and physically aggressive encounter between heterosexual dating partners and made repeated judgments about the interaction. Results from this study provided evidence for the validation of this methodology and found that history of physical forms of IPV was associated with risk recognition ability, such that victims of IPV were less likely to recognize the danger involved in the video vignette compared to nonvictims. Results showed important implications for IPV prevention programs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this recently published <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/archpediatrics.2009.237">study</a> in the <em>Archives of Pediatric &amp; Adolescent Medicine</em>, the researchers found a home visiting program to reduce intimate partner violence.</p>
<p>Note: this study uses the Conflict Tactics Scale. <a href="http://new.vawnet.org/category/Main_Doc.php?docid=388" class="broken_link">Some researchers have concerns about that tool</a>.</p>

<p><strong><span id="more-7219"></span>Reducing maternal intimate partner violence after the birth of a child: a randomized controlled trial of the Hawaii healthy start home visitation program.</strong></p>
<p>Bair-Merritt MH, Jennings JM, Chen R, Burrell L, McFarlane E, Fuddy L, Duggan AK. <em>Archives of Pediatric &amp; Adolescent Medicine</em> 2010; 164(1): 16-23.</p>
<p>Click <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/archpediatrics.2009.237">here</a> for a link to the abstract on the journal’s web site.</p>
<p>(Copyright © 2010, American Medical Association)</p>
<p>OBJECTIVES: To estimate whether home visitation beginning after childbirth was associated with changes in average rates of mothers&#8217; intimate partner violence (IPV) victimization and perpetration as well as rates of specific IPV types (physical assault, verbal abuse, sexual assault, and injury) during the 3 years of program implementation and during 3 years of long-term follow-up.</p>
<p>DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial.</p>
<p>SETTING: Oahu, Hawaii.</p>
<p>PARTICIPANTS: Six hundred forty-three families with an infant at high risk for child maltreatment born between November 1994 and December 1995. Intervention Home visitors provided direct services and linked families to community resources. Home visits were to initially occur weekly and to continue for at least 3 years.</p>
<p>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Women&#8217;s self-reports of past-year IPV victimization and perpetration using the Conflict Tactics Scale. Blinded research staff conducted maternal interviews following the child&#8217;s birth and annually when children were aged 1 to 3 years and then 7 to 9 years.</p>
<p>RESULTS: During program implementation, intervention mothers as compared with control mothers reported lower rates of IPV victimization (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.73-1.01) and significantly lower rates of perpetration (IRR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.72-0.96). Considering specific IPV types, intervention women reported significantly lower rates of physical assault victimization (IRR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.71-1.00) and perpetration (IRR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.70-0.96). During long-term follow-up, rates of overall IPV victimization and perpetration decreased, with nonsignificant between-group differences. Verbal abuse victimization rates (IRR, 1.14, 95% CI, 0.97-1.34) may have increased among intervention mothers.</p>
<p>CONCLUSION: Early-childhood home visitation may be a promising strategy for reducing IPV.</p>

<p>Veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) consistently evidence higher rates of intimate partner aggression perpetration than veterans without PTSD, but most studies have examined rates of aggression among Vietnam veterans several years after their deployment. The primary aim of this study was to examine partner aggression among male Afghanistan or Iraq veterans who served during Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and compare this aggression to that reported by Vietnam veterans with PTSD. Three groups were recruited, OEF/OIF veterans with PTSD (n = 27), OEF/OIF veterans without PTSD (n = 31), and Vietnam veterans with PTSD (n = 28). Though only a few comparisons reached significance, odds ratios suggested that male OEF/OIF veterans with PTSD were approximately 1.9 to 3.1 times more likely to perpetrate aggression toward their female partners and 1.6 to 6 times more likely to report experiencing female perpetrated aggression than the other two groups. Significant correlations among reports of violence perpetrated and sustained suggested many men may have been in mutually violent relationships. Taken together, these results suggest that partner aggression among Iraq and Afghanistan veterans with PTSD may be an important treatment consideration and target for prevention.</p>

<p>I admit that the article, <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10508-009-9553-z">The &#8220;Participating Victim&#8221; in the Study of Erotic Experiences Between Children and Adults: An Historical Analysis</a> was hard for me to read.  I understand the value of recognizing that children have sexual feelings, but I find the frame of this article troublesome.  If the term “participating victim” is vanishing from the research literature, I celebrate that development.</p>
<p>And why does the term “erotic experiences between children and adults” have to be used in research journals in 2009?</p>

<p>During the 20th century, erotic experiences between minors and adults occupied a position of increasing interest, both public as well as scientific. In this area of research, one of the most notable evolutions in how these experiences are treated has been the progressive disappearance and/or the intense redefinition of what earlier researchers called &#8220;participating victims,&#8221; i.e., minors apparently interested in accepting and/or sustaining these relationships. The present work, through a comparative analysis of the literature, seeks to substantiate this transformation during the second third of the 20th century. It will also argue that this evolution can be fundamentally explained in terms of the intense emotional, moral, and ideological importance that is ascribed to these experiences in the rise of the current victimological paradigm. Finally, this study endeavors to contribute to the understanding of childhood and the scientific study of child sexuality as well as of these experiences with adults.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recent articles by highlight the links between <a href="http://calcasa.org/prevention/alcohol’s-role-in-sexual-coercion/" class="broken_link">alcohol and sexual coercion for perpetration</a> and<a href="http://calcasa.org/prevention/drug-use-and-ipv-among-college-students/"> drug use associated with intimate partner violence</a>. This recent <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0886260509354581" class="broken_link">article</a> ePublished in the <em>Journal of Interpersonal Violence</em> examines the role of alcohol experiences on protective behaviors.</p>
<p>Prevention cannot be done solely by trying to ensure that potential victims protect themselves. Nor does it seem reasonable to expect potential perpetrators to individually realize that their behavior is wrong. How can we change the environment around alcohol experiences that will reduce sexual violence?</p>

<p>Alcohol use and sexual assault on college campuses are highly prevalent and the focus of numerous prevention and intervention efforts. Our goals were to gain a greater understanding of the relationship between coercive sexual experiences, utilization of protective behavioral strategies and alcohol expectancies and consumption among male and female college students. We surveyed 370 college students regarding their past year experiences and found that 34% of women and 31% of men reported unwanted sexual contact, 6% of women and 13% of men reported engaging in sexually coercive behavior, and 4% of women and 9% of men reported experiencing both unwanted contact and engaging in sexually coercive behavior. Findings indicated students who experienced unwanted sexual contact reported significant differences in alcohol expectancies. More specifically, those who engaged in sexually coercive behaviors had significantly higher sex-related alcohol expectancies. In addition, recipients of unwanted contact reported higher alcohol consumption, used fewer protective strategies when drinking, and experienced more negative consequences due to their alcohol use. Results suggest that campus alcohol and sexual assault prevention efforts should include information on alcohol expectancies and use of protective strategies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://calcasa.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/social-ecological-model.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6876" title="social-ecological model" src="http://calcasa.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/social-ecological-model.jpg" alt="" width="329" height="134" /></a>I find the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/ncipc/dvp/social-ecological-model_DVP.htm">social-ecological model</a> to be a helpful concept in understanding prevention because it highlights the importance of thinking beyond the individual level to create lasting change.  However, so much of the research on sexual violence and intimate partner violence focused on the individual.</p>
<p>I was pleased to see the recently epublished study <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0886260509354497" class="broken_link">Neighborhood Characteristics as Predictors of Male to Female and Female to Male Partner Violence</a>. While the study did not find links between intimate partner violence and the neighborhood characteristics examined, the study asks the of type questions that researchers should investigate.</p>
<p>What community based measures do you think might be associated with sexual violence and intimate partner violence?</p>

<p><strong>Neighborhood Characteristics as Predictors of Male to Female and Female to Male Partner Violence.</strong></p>
<p>Caetano R, Ramisetty-Mikler S, Harris TR. Journal of Interpersonal Violence 2009; ePublished December 29, 2009</p>
<p>Click <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0886260509354497" class="broken_link">here</a> for the abstract on the journal’s web site.</p>

<p>This article examines the association between neighborhood characteristics at the census tract-level, couples&#8217; perceived neighborhood social cohesion and informal social control, and male-to-female (MFPV) and female-to-male (FMPV) partner violence in the United States. Data come from a second wave of interviews (2000) with a national sample of couples 18 years of age and older who were first interviewed in 1995. The path analysis shows that poverty is associated with perceived social cohesion and perceived social control as hypothesized. However, there is no significant mediation effect for social control or social cohesion on any type of violence. In the path analysis, Black ethnicity is associated with social cohesion, which is associated with MFPV. Intimate partner violence (IPV), as a form of domestic violence, may not be as concentrated in high-poverty neighborhoods as criminal violence. IPV may be more determined by personal and dyadic characteristics than criminal violence.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: This study used the revised Conflict Tactics Scale. As I have noted before, <a href="http://new.vawnet.org/category/Main_Doc.php?docid=388" class="broken_link">many researchers have concerns about this instrument</a>.</p>
